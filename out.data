From fairest creatures we desire increase,	s	Has checked the outlaw's way ; 	b
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:	s	Ah ! my dear father, tell me why ? 	b
His tender heir might bear his memory:	s	But what shall brave the deep, deep waves 	b
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,	s	And gives the waves a brighter blue, 	b
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,	s	Stooped, and raised his languid head ; 	b
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.	s	Subdue this quenchless will ! ' 	b
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament	s	He felt for all the beauty there. 	b
And only herald to the gaudy spring,	s	Turn back, from that tempestuous surge, 	b
Within thine own bud buriest thy content	s	Before it fades away ! 	b
And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.	s	When winter winds were wild . 	b
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,	s	Warm and bright on Arden's lake 	b
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.	s	All my life's bliss from thy dear life was given, 	b
When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,	s	Who motionless is laid . . . 	b
Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,	s	Of southern waters breaking to the wind, 	b
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,	s	And laughter sink into a sigh, 	b
Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:	s	Their sunlit isles of paradise, 	b
Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,	s	The vain man smile, the fool deride, 	b
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,	s	4 This is my home where whirlwinds blow, 	b
To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,	s	1 'd call forth the glorious chorus again 	b
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.	s	With blood on his hand that he wept to have shed ? 	b
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine	s	The space between is all forgot, 	b
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'	s	* But, I '11 not fear, I will not weep 	b
Proving his beauty by succession thine!	s	Oh, stars, and dreams, and gentle night ; 	b
This were to be new made when thou art old,	s	I have one rite a gentle kiss ; 	b
Now is the time that face should form another;	s	When those who were thy own compeers, 	b
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,	s	All Nature's million mysteries, 	b
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.	s	To reach, at last, the eternal home, 	b
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb	s	Was flitting o'er me evermore. 	b
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?	s	But something whispers to my mind, 	b
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb	s	What though the stars and fair moonlight 	b
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee	s	And who with unregretful eyes 	b
Calls back the lovely April of her prime:	s	But sweet was the slight and spicy smell 	b
So thou through windows of thine age shall see	s	Opening its ports for me and mine ; 	b
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.	s	Implored to change for senseless rest 	b
But if thou live, remember'd not to be,	s	How still, how happy ! These are words 	b
Die single, and thine image dies with thee.	s	And what is thine that it should prove 	b
Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend	s	And fresh winds shook the door ; 	b
Cupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:	s	That I shall greet them ne'er again ! ' 	b
Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,	s	Dare not indulge in memory's rapturous pain ; 	b
And being frank she lends to those are free.	s	And conquered good and conquering ill 	b
The bounteous largess given thee to give?	s	Gladly to see his gory sun 	b
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use	s	Nay, smile to hear Death's billows rave- 	b
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?	s	Is human love so true ? 	b
For having traffic with thyself alone,	s	The strength of eyesight to restore 	b
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.	s	My monarch died to rule for ever 	b
Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,	s	Unawed, the darkness of the grave ? 	b
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?	s	Which wilder visions muster'd to my mind ; 	b
Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee,	s	Clothe in blood its sovereign's prayer. 	b
Which, used, lives th' executor to be.	s	Hark ! listen to the distant gun 	b
Those hours, that with gentle work did frame	s	Yet vainly flowed the calmer wave 	b
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,	s	None need point the princely victim, 	b
Will play the tyrants to the very same	s	* And now, 'mid northern mountains lone 	b
And that unfair which fairly doth excel:	s	Are warring night and day ; 	b
For never-resting time leads summer on	s	From those brown hills, have melted into spring : 	b
To hideous winter and confounds him there;	s	On the shady side reclined 	b
Sap check'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,	s	On antique roof and hoary tree, 	b
Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:	s	That flush of roseate light, 	b
Then, were not summer's distillation left,	s	None but me beheld him dying, 	b
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:	s	No ; 'twas not the flowery plain : 	b
But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,	s	Has Almadore in battle bled ! 	b
Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.	s	The yells, the groans, the frenzied gladness, 	b
Then let not winter's ragged hand deface	s	Their careless young eyes are closed in sleeping ; 	b
In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:	s	T' escape from labour's tyrant power 	b
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place	s	November's gusts unheeded call ; 	b
With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd.	s	Doth he not rather roam ? 	b
That use is not forbidden usury,	s	And glowed both roof and floor ; 	b
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;	s	And not one of all my lays 	b
Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;	s	1 Ice has barred the Arctic waters, 	b
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,	s	The future fills me with dismay ; 	b
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:	s	Felt, but unseen, the damp dewdrops fall. 	b
Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,	s	From those eternal waves that surge below. 	b
Leaving thee living in posterity?	s	Rattled against an old vault's rail. 	b
Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair	s	When that grim concave frowned above, 	b
Lo! in the orient when the gracious light	s	A thoughtful spirit taught me soon, 	b
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye	s	There if he can to die alone ? ' 	b
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,	s	When it has worn through many a week 	b
Serving with looks his sacred majesty;	s	Because thy soul is clear ; 	b
And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,	s	For ever triumphing : 	b
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,	s	Too truly agonised to weep, 	b
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,	s	Through wind and ocean's roar, 	b
Attending on his golden pilgrimage;	s	The face, all deadly fair, 	b
But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,	s	Winds take a pensive tone, and stars a tender fire, 	b
Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,	s	AH ! why, because the dazzling sun 	b
The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are	s	But voiceless silence everywhere. 	b
From his low tract and look another way:	s	December's sullen time ! 	b
So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,	s	Hope soothes me in the griefs I know ; 	b
Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son.	s	Can rob us of the past. 	b
Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?	s	That now I cannot feel ! 	b
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.	s	That Death he took a certain aim, 	b
Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,	s	The grave is drear, but they are not there : 	b
That is so proud thy service to despise,	s	Away, away, resign thee now 	b
Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest	s	How every drift in their glens profound 	b
By unions married, do offend thine ear,	s	Or bless not me with heaven ! * 	b
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds	s	There is no need of other sound 	b
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.	s	Of youth's delight, when youth is past, 	b
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,	s	Day by day some dreary token 	b
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,	s	But hope is dead for him. 	b
Resembling sire and child and happy mother	s	She scarcely feels the flow ; 	b
Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:	s	Faltering, faint, and ready to die. 	b
Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,	s	Begins another voyage nay, they 're gone ; 	b
Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'	s	1 see them foaming high ; 	b
Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye	s	Before their hearts went wandering wrong, 	b
That thou consumest thyself in single life?	s	From tracking farther day by day, 	b
Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die.	s	Day breathes such beauty over earth and sky, 	b
The world will wail thee, like a makeless wife;	s	Raised on my pillow, to descry 	b
The world will be thy widow and still weep	s	And, in the red fire's cheerful glow, 	b
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,	s	And Lord Eldred glancing round, 	b
When every private widow well may keep	s	And thou false friend and treacherous guide 	b
By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind.	s	And never radiant bow could be 	b
Look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend	s	Drinks tears, instead of dew ; 	b
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;	s	A winter sunset in the west 	b
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,	s	A faithless heart to thee ? 	b
And kept unused, the user so destroys it.	s	And let Thy holy Spirit shine 	b
No love toward others in that bosom sits	s	Darken that triumphant eye ! 	b
That on himself such murderous shame commits.	s	Blood-red, he rose, and, arrow-straight, 	b
For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,	s	Where tears and mourning cannot come. 	b
And so the general of hot desire	s	That wander down to drink the tide. 	b
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,	s	Enough if storms have bowed his head, 	b
But that thou none lovest is most evident;	s	Even Memory's voice grew dim ; 	b
For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate	s	For round their hearths they'll tell this 	b
That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire.	s	Yet, loved one, it must be : 	b
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate	s	More drear I cannot be ! 	b
Which to repair should be thy chief desire.	s	Those sad relics scattered round ; 	b
'I hate' from hate away she threw,	s	The giant sons of Anakim 	b
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?	s	Sweet, how softly sweet it came 	b
Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,	s	And all around his youthful brow 	b
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:	s	With alien breezes sadly blent. 	b
That beauty still may live in thine or thee.	s	All her cherished hopes should wane, 	b
As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest	s	SWART steed of night, thou hast charged thy last 	b
In one of thine, from that which thou departest;	s	Its face is fair divinely fair ; 	b
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.	s	It will not, cannot rise ; 	b
Without this, folly, age and cold decay:	s	But if that night bring only sleep, 	b
If all were minded so, the times should cease	s	Deep in unknown eternity ; 	b
And threescore year would make the world away.	s	How could I seek the empty world again ? 	b
Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,	s	My eyes are full of tears, 	b
Harsh featureless and rude, barrenly perish:	s	No later light has lightened up my heaven, 	b
She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby	s	Where evening closes dark and chill ; 	b
Those lips that Love's own hand did make	s	The soul to feel the flesh, and the flesh to feel the 	b
When I do count the clock that tells the time,	s	Concludes thy musing once again ? 	b
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;	s	' O DAY ! he cannot die 	b
When I behold the violet past prime,	s	To breathe its bliss on me ; 	b
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves	s	Through this false world, their all had 	b
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,	s	The stream in silence sang once more 	b
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves	s	And woke her with a sudden song ; 	b
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,	s	Roderic, for thee shall never rise ! 	b
Then of thy beauty do I question make,	s	With my consoling tear? 	b
That thou among the wastes of time must go,	s	To the enduring seas 	b
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake	s	THE ABSENT ONE 	b
And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence	s	O then another daybreak 	b
Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.	s	And grew in another bed ; 	b
O, that you were yourself! but, love, you are	s	1 Oh, for the time when I shall sleep 	b
No longer yours than you yourself here live:	s	DREAM, where art thou now ? 	b
Against this coming end you should prepare,	s	Such tears as I weep it is not so ! 	b
And your sweet semblance to some other give.	s	And voiceless, soulless, messenger, 	b
Find no determination: then you were	s	O gallant horse, hold on thy course ; 	b
Yourself again after yourself's decease,	s	But still they gave no certain token 	b
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,	s	The captive raised her face ; it was as soft and 	b
Which husbandry in honour might uphold	s	To the deadliest press of the gathering fight 	b
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day	s	Though not because my heart is tame, 	b
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?	s	' And why should we be glad at all ? 	b
O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know	s	Oh, for the day, when I shall rest, 	b
You had a father: let your son say so.	s	Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine ; 	b
Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;	s	1 And thou art gone with all thy pride ; 	b
And yet methinks I have astronomy,	s	They were clothed in savage attire ; 	b
But not to tell of good or evil luck,	s	For the woe I could not bear 	b
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;	s	Than other love, more true? 	b
Making a famine where abundance lies,	s	Must always fade, and always cloy : 	b
Or say with princes if it shall go well,	s	One long look, that sore reproved me 	b
By oft predict that I in heaven find:	s	I am thinking of my latest shock, 	b
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,	s	For now might Faith decay. 	b
And, constant stars, in them I read such art	s	Sit beneath the ancient thorn. 	b
If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;	s	And morning's beams will rise as drear. 	b
Or else of thee this I prognosticate:	s	Their happy souls are gone to God I 	b
Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.	s	Buried in a hapless tomb. 	b
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;	s	Clouded, even as they would weep. 	b
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows	s	And, while the wide earth echoing rung 	b
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;	s	I ne'er had raised this coward cry 	b
Cheered and check'd even by the self-same sky,	s	To leave our children slaves ! 	b
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,	s	She heard the river's restless wave 	b
And wear their brave state out of memory;	s	The vast crowds vanished every one ; 	b
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay	s	And 'mid flowery, smiling plains ; 	b
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,	s	That we may overflow the sky 	b
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,	s	I shall smile when wreaths of snow 	b
To change your day of youth to sullied night;	s	Till the tufted leaves of the garden bower 	b
And all in war with Time for love of you,	s	But not of wail for men ! 	b
But wherefore do not you a mightier way	s	Ah ! no : with louder sound 	b
Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?	s	Gone by as if they 'd never been ; 	b
And fortify yourself in your decay	s	No ; turn towards the western side. 	b
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?	s	Or unreal phantoms of distress ! 	b
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,	s	Her spirit is the unfathomed lake 	b
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:	s	Adoring virtue's distant star. 	b
So should the lines of life that life repair,	s	ON a sunny brae alone I lay 	b
Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,	s	Wrought up in rain and wailing wind : 	b
No marvel then, though I mistake my view;	s	Youthful he seemed but worn as they 	b
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.	s	THE evening sun was sinking down 	b
To give away yourself keeps yourself still,	s	Exhausted with repinings vain, 	b
And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.	s	The grass-grown grave, did lie, 	b
Who will believe my verse in time to come,	s	Daughter divine ! and could his gaze 	b
Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb	s	Where will these bright things be ? 	b
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.	s	The grand remains of ancient state. 	b
If I could write the beauty of your eyes	s	And, all for listening, never sleep. 	b
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,	s	In all His works displayed. 	b
The age to come would say 'This poet lies:	s	To greet the general glow. 	b
Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'	s	With a wild and passing thrill, 	b
So should my papers yellow'd with their age	s	Are shadowed by her hand at last 	b
Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue,	s	grant thy prayer ? 	b
And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage	s	To wander through the snow. 	b
But were some child of yours alive that time,	s	Nor ever let my spirit tire, 	b
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?	s	And while on that reflected face 	b
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:	s	And cold suspicion never rise ; 	b
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,	s	Where thou, and I, and Liberty, 	b
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:	s	Burned within the avenging flame : 	b
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,	s	It is but thought full many a night 	b
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;	s	For them a thousand hopes remain, 	b
And every fair from fair sometime declines,	s	The evening comes before the noon, 	b
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;	s	With heart as summer sunshine light 	b
But thy eternal summer shall not fade	s	A wanderer o'er the Atlantic main ; 	b
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;	s	Till sorrow's source were dry, 	b
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,	s	Could that sacrifice have purchased 	b
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:	s	Its green boughs in the breezy sky. 	b
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,	s	And cheek almost as white as death, 	b
So long lives this and this gives life to thee.	s	Was it with the fields of green, 	b
Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,	s	Have long forgot their vow ; 	b
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;	s	The flowers of Fancy, newly-blown : 	b
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,	s	The starry halls of Elrington 	b
And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;	s	This glorious vision of a grove, 	b
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,	s	New glories o'er the blighted spring, 	b
And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,	s	Wild the road, and rough and dreary ; 	b
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;	s	And yet there is or seems at least to be 	b
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:	s	1 Our guests are darkly lodged,' I whisper'd, gazing 	b
O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,	s	And only wake with you ! 	b
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;	s	Bowed lowest at thy shrine, 	b
Him in thy course untainted do allow	s	The little glittering spirits sung, 	b
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.	s	And every vision of old Afric's shore 	b
Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,	s	And my remorse shall die. 	b
My love shall in my verse ever live young.	s	And sweeter hope, when hope despairs ! 	b
A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted	s	When the wearied host of the conqueror lies 	b
Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;	s	And the purple violet sweet ; 	b
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted	s	This day on Elmor Hill ! ! ! ' 	b
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;	s	While heaven and earth are whispering me, 	b
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,	s	His own creation's dread despair ! 	b
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;	s	King Julius lifts his impious eye 	b
A man in hue, all 'hues' in his controlling,	s	Round her returning sight appear 	b
Much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.	s	In English fields my limbs were laid, 	b
And for a woman wert thou first created;	s	I dreamt one dark and stormy night 	b
Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,	s	The spirit sent his dazzling gaze 	b
And by addition me of thee defeated,	s	It gathers up thoughts akin to madness, 	b
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.	s	My heart's blood flows to buy the blessing to 	b
But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,	s	I was at peace, and drank your beams 	b
Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.	s	Might fill with sympathy. 	b
So is it not with me as with that Muse	s	To twilight's shade forlorn ? 	b
Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,	s	What made her weep, what made her glide 	b
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use	s	A wider sound than mountain wind 	b
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse	s	Yet still steeped in memory's dyes 	b
Making a couplement of proud compare,	s	Above me, in that stormless sea, 	b
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,	s	I long to hope that all the woe 	b
With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare	s	In summer's pride imbue 	b
O' let me, true in love, but truly write,	s	Then I shall rest, while thou wilt weep. 	b
And then believe me, my love is as fair	s	Yet ever in my grateful breast 	b
To make me give the lie to my true sight,	s	Where thick the leaves are dancing, 	b
As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:	s	It was thus I said as her graceful head 	b
Let them say more than like of hearsay well;	s	My mortal flesh you might debar, 	b
I will not praise that purpose not to sell.	s	They gain the rock's steep wall. 	b
My glass shall not persuade me I am old,	s	Ye earthly cares begone ! 	b
So long as youth and thou are of one date;	s	Or Virtue crouched to Infamy ; 	b
But when in thee time's furrows I behold,	s	For I Ve been consecrate to grief 	b
Then look I death my days should expiate.	s	Some were dazzling like the sun ; 	b
For all that beauty that doth cover thee	s	That struggles in thy breast 	b
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,	s	A murmuring round the wall. 	b
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:	s	My downy couch with silk was hung. 	b
How can I then be elder than thou art?	s	And helpless Reason warn in vain ; 	b
O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary	s	Glides through the maze of pleasure wild. 	b
As I, not for myself, but for thee will;	s	And Peace, the lethargy of Grief ; 	b
Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary	s	And Hope, a phantom of the soul ; 	b
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.	s	He ever held in his arms. 	b
Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;	s	LADYBIRD ! ladybird ! fly away home, 	b
Thou gavest me thine, not to give back again.	s	And trembling yet to hear his name, 	b
As an unperfect actor on the stage	s	While nightly stars are burning, 	b
And taught it thus anew to greet:	s	While evening pours its silent dew, 	b
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,	s	And will not heaven itself bestow 	b
Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart.	s	I trust not to thy phantom bliss, 	b
So I, for fear of trust, forget to say	s	'My master's voice is low, his aspect bland and 	b
The perfect ceremony of love's rite,	s	Yet the faint wind comes soothingly 	b
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,	s	Round walls where only you are vigil keeping? 	b
O'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might.	s	To-morrow both shall soar away, 	b
O, let my books be then the eloquence	s	Winds sigh as you are sighing, 	b
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,	s	Entreating, till his eyes o'erflowed, 	b
More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.	s	Gaze on the wretch recall to mind 	b
O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:	s	My spirit should startle their rest and tell, 	b
When I break twenty? I am perjured most;	s	Since misery was such misery. 	b
Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd	s	To dungeons where a prisoner lies? 	b
Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;	s	PLEAD FOR ME 	b
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,	s	STILL beside that dreary water 	b
And perspective it is the painter's art.	s	And now the twilight calm and sweet 	b
For through the painter must you see his skill,	s	They stood by mute and pale ; 	b
To find where your true image pictured lies;	s	Restored into the Deity.' 	b
Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,	s	And tell why I have chosen thee ! 	b
But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;	s	A prayer that would come forth altho' it lingered 	b
Past cure I am, now reason is past care,	s	And twenty years of tyrant pride 	b
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me	s	O'er all the crossing thoughts that overflowed. 	b
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;	s	No, radiant angel, speak and say 	b
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;	s	And it sprung and flourished ; 	b
They draw but what they see, know not the heart.	s	Thou bear'st the dim tie of ceaseless dreams, 	b
Let those who are in favour with their stars	s	The earth shone round with a long-lost charm : 	b
Of public honour and proud titles boast,	s	For Thine own sake, be Thou its guide, 	b
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,	s	It had gathered beauty from sunshine and shower, 	b
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.	s	BETWEEN distress and pleasure 	b
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread	s	Glance from her eyes, with mimic rays, 	b
But as the marigold at the sun's eye,	s	The moor-lark in the air, 	b
And in themselves their pride lies buried,	s	And saw my offerings on their shrine ; 	b
The painful warrior famoused for fight,	s	I thought that Gabriel's self had come 	b
Is from the book of honour razed quite,	s	Weighed beneath a mortal sleep ; 	b
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:	s	So, with a ready heart, I swore 	b
Then happy I, that love and am beloved	s	To seek their altar-stone no more ; 	b
Where I may not remove nor be removed.	s	His soul has felt the storm below, 	b
Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage	s	Behold him 1 	b
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,	s	And set my spirit free ? 	b
To witness duty, not to show my wit:	s	He must have once been beautiful, 	b
Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine	s	Because we dare not stay to gain 	b
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,	s	Like vultures round their prey. 	b
But that I hope some good conceit of thine	s	A weak and helpless prey ! 	b
In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it;	s	How loud the storm sounds round the hall ! 	b
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving	s	My darling pain that wounds and sears, 	b
Points on me graciously with fair aspect	s	Rude the couch that rests us weary ; 	b
And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,	s	Rested from the battle's roar ; 	b
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:	s	As she would seek repose ; 	b
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;	s	Mine eye to meet her eye ; 	b
Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me.	s	And am I wrong to worship where 	b
Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,	s	wind that blows ; 	b
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;	s	Of heavy rain or tempest near. 	b
But then begins a journey in my head,	s	Would part and sunlight shone between, 	b
To work my mind, when body's work's expired:	s	And tell why I have chosen thee ! 	b
For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,	s	* THE evening passes fast away, 	b
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,	s	Lips, that did breathe no murmuring 	b
Looking on darkness which the blind do see	s	The wild birds raise their brood ; 	b
Save that my soul's imaginary sight	s	What feelings in thy breast?' 	b
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,	s	One moment, ere I go 	b
Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,	s	Of labour hardly done ; 	b
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.	s	A thousand thousand silvery lyres 	b
Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,	s	But this world's life has much to dread, 	b
For thee and for myself no quiet find.	s	What shadow is it 	b
And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,	s	Bliss like thine is bought by years 	b
That am debarr'd the benefit of rest?	s	'Tis sweet to wander here at night, 	b
But found no cure: the bath for my help lies	s	I 'M happiest now when most away 	b
But day by night, and night by day, oppress'd?	s	One gleam of her heaven-bright face to see. 	b
Do in consent shake hands to torture me;	s	And Time should Fate condemn ; 	b
The one by toil, the other to complain	s	Which coming death denied ; 	b
How far I toil, still farther off from thee.	s	* Then art thou glad to seek repose ? 	b
I tell the day, to please them thou art bright	s	The bee among the heather bells 	b
Till my bad angel fire my good one out.	s	AND first an hour of mournful musing, 	b
So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,	s	And earth looks back so dazzling bright 	b
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.	s	As the dear friend untimely called away ; 	b
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse	s	And call a lovelier Life from Death, 	b
And night doth nightly make grief's strength	s	I breathed not but to send above 	b
When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,	s	That comforts me while thou art here, 	b
I all alone beweep my outcast state	s	Palace and temple crown the glade. 	b
And look upon myself and curse my fate,	s	As one who mourns the dead. 	b
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,	s	Why did the morning dawn to break 	b
Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,	s	And would not pass away ! 	b
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,	s	Lament their absence drear ; 	b
With what I most enjoy contented least;	s	Over my western beauty's grave, 	b
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,	s	Patriot fathers' bloody tombs ; 	b
Like to the lark at break of day arising	s	Would rather fight than rest. ' 	b
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.	s	No ; that tree with branches riven 	b
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought	s	And sleet and frozen gloom ? 	b
I summon up remembrance of things past,	s	With my dear comrades young and gay, 	b
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,	s	This very crowd is vacancy ; 	b
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:	s	I chide with my soul I bid it cherish 	b
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,	s	From bleak December's sky ? 	b
And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,	s	They deluge my heart like the rain 	b
And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:	s	Within its mossy cell. 	b
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,	s	How gloomy grows the night ! Tis Gondal's 	b
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er	s	But God is not like human kind, 	b
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,	s	Shall meet our dearest, when we die ; 	b
O me, what eyes hath Love put in my head,	s	Buried in moors and mountains wild, 	b
All losses are restored and sorrows end.	s	Defeat serenely borne, 	b
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun	s	Which but because more broken gleams 	b
And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,	s	And visions rise, and change, that kill me with 	b
And all those friends which I thought buried.	s	The tiny fountain, churning spray 	b
How many a holy and obsequious tear	s	Saved thee from a deadlier thrall. 	b
Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye	s	Even where he yearns to be I 	b
As interest of the dead, which now appear	s	From the fresh root of Eternity ! 	b
But things removed that hidden in thee lie!	s	And I may sing and muse aloud, 	b
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,	s	Their timid forms to guard from harm ; 	b
Who all their parts of me to thee did give;	s	I love thee, boy, for all divine, 	b
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,	s	From the dark marble to the sky, 	b
Their images I loved I view in thee,	s	Sorrow passed, and plucked the golden blossom ; 	b
And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.	s	And hush that music's solemn sound, 	b
If thou survive my well-contented day,	s	But, within its parent's kindly bosom, 	b
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,	s	My love, altho' the very dead 	b
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey	s	Without the veil between. 	b
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,	s	Can friendship's flower droop for years 	b
Compare them with the bettering of the time,	s	Will forsake thy memory, 	b
And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,	s	All mist and tempest free? 	b
Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,	s	And, behold ! with tenfold increase blessing, 	b
Exceeded by the height of happier men.	s	Spring adorned the beauty-burdened spray ; 	b
O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:	s	The moonbeams softly shine. 	b
'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,	s	For many a week and many a day 	b
A dearer birth than this his love had brought,	s	The waveless ocean of repose. 	b
To march in ranks of better equipage:	s	Than Native's heaven can pour. 	b
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,	s	Down through that ocean's gloomy night ; 	b
Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.'	s	Cruel Death ! The young leaves droop and 	b
Full many a glorious morning have I seen	s	When flowers were closed and day was o'er 	b
Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,	s	No ! the morning sunshine mocks my anguish 	b
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,	s	The thrilling shouts of fighting men, 	b
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;	s	She was cruel in her fear ; 	b
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride	s	Was only sullen there ! 	b
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,	s	If our vessels sailed adverse on life's stormy main. 	b
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:	s	AT CASTLE WOOD 	b
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,	s	But as in fit of peevish woe, 	b
But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;	s	'Cumber the spirit that would soar 	b
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.	s	The outward tumult seemed to assuage 	b
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;	s	Out to the park this dreary day, 	b
Revenge upon myself with present moan?	s	She turns from heaven a tearless eye 	b
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,	s	Even weeping o'er that wretch's woe ; 	b
And make me travel forth without my cloak,	s	And mingled with a foreign mould. 	b
To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,	s	One sign of sympathising woe, 	b
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?	s	A snowy brow in ringlets small, 	b
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,	s	Till at last, all old links broken, 	b
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,	s	Vain as thou wert, and weak as vain, 	b
For no man well of such a salve can speak	s	Make answer far and near. 	b
The fairest votary took up that fire	s	And this is just the joyous hour 	b
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:	s	Thy soul is powerless over mine.' 	b
The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief	s	She would not, in her tranquil sleep, 	b
To him that bears the strong offence's cross.	s	She thought when that confession crossed 	b
Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,	s	Do I despise the timid deer, 	b
And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.	s	Chain and bar and dungeon wall 	b
Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;	s	And heaven itself, so pure and blest, 	b
All men make faults, and even I in this,	s	And still entreated him to stay. 	b
Authorizing thy trespass with compare,	s	And he was once an ardent boy ; 	b
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;	s	I saw His wisdom and His power 	b
Where Cupid got new fire--my mistress' eyes.	s	And nothing in the twilight sky 	b
Thy adverse party is thy advocate--	s	How can I rouse my sinking soul 	b
And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:	s	Say, ' Earth, lie lightly on that breast, 	b
Such civil war is in my love and hate	s	Tortured Gondal's liberty ! 	b
That I an accessary needs must be	s	The wind blew from the sea. 	b
Desire is death, which physic did except.	s	But the joy of life was flown 	b
For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings	s	And every window glistens bright 	b
So shall those blots that do with me remain	s	With leaves of frozen dew. 	b
Without thy help by me be borne alone.	s	O look again, for still on high 	b
In our two loves there is but one respect,	s	And lights your room like day ; 	b
Though in our lives a separable spite,	s	Bright be thine eyes, undimmed their dazzling 	b
Which though it alter not love's sole effect,	s	We thought, t When winter comes again. 	b
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.	s	Ere I would call its glories mine ; 	b
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,	s	Its root has felt a worm, 	b
Nor thou with public kindness honour me,	s	Why dost thou repeat again 	b
Unless thou take that honour from thy name:	s	Till those dark orbs o'erflowing fast 	b
And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend	s	4 Listen ! I Ve known a burning heart, 	b
As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.	s	' Edward, awake, awake 	b
As a decrepit father takes delight	s	And every time its measured call 	b
So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,	s	A thousand forms, a fearful gloom ; 	b
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.	s	Or gleams the sun amongst the mists of care? 	b
Or any of these all, or all, or more,	s	' When tempests roar on the lonely shore 	b
Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit,	s	The aimless, heedless carelessness 	b
I make my love engrafted to this store:	s	His red heart's blood drenched my dagger ; 	b
So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,	s	The music of the Sabbath bell. 	b
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give	s	The sunshine of a summer's sun 	b
That I in thy abundance am sufficed	s	My cold heart, underneath my hand, 	b
And by a part of all thy glory live.	s	Or wakes the breeze in the swaying trees 	b
When I against myself with thee partake?	s	THE day is done, the winter sun 	b
This wish I have; then ten times happy me!	s	The heart is dead in infancy, 	b
How can my Muse want subject to invent,	s	To hide the streaming tear. 	b
While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse	s	Nor marked how from his own young 	b
Thine own sweet argument, too excellent	s	To-morrow, Scorn will blight my name, 	b
For every vulgar paper to rehearse?	s	Thus poured she in that cavern wild 	b
O, give thyself the thanks, if aught in me	s	Will load me with a coward's shame 	b
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;	s	'Twas thus I thought, an hour ago, 	b
For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,	s	And at each belt a weapon dire, 	b
When thou thyself dost give invention light?	s	Too heavenly now, but doomed to be, 	b
Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth	s	I cannot find a haven. 	b
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;	s	When thy heart bounds ardently, 	b
And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth	s	His followers went out with Jubilee, 	b
Eternal numbers to outlive long date.	s	Their dust is mingled with the sod, 	b
If my slight Muse do please these curious days,	s	Should cause such bitter woe? 	b
O, how thy worth with manners may I sing,	s	Sad thoughts rose in my mind. 	b
When thou art all the better part of me?	s	For, who forgives the accursed crime 	b
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?	s	The violet's eye might shyly flash, 	b
And what is 't but mine own when I praise thee?	s	OH, thy bright eyes must answer now, 	b
Even for this let us divided live,	s	Thy presence waked a thrilling tone 	b
And our dear love lose name of single one,	s	Where can the weary lay his head, 	b
That by this separation I may give	s	There have been times when this was drear, 	b
That due to thee which thou deservest alone.	s	But, traitor, traitor, from that word 	b
O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,	s	All true breasts shrink away ! 	b
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave	s	The spirit above my couch was bending. 	b
O, though I love what others do abhor,	s	A slave, because I rule thee still ; 	b
And that thou teachest how to make one twain,	s	As I can hear the ocean's fall 	b
By praising him here who doth hence remain!	s	My honour's name to spare ! 	b
When all my best doth worship thy defect,	s	And earth seemed such an alien home 	b
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?	s	* What seek you now on this bleak moor brow, 	b
To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.	s	A sound of music reached my ear : 	b
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,	s	And there you pass, in happy dreams, 	b
Then if for my love thou my love receivest,	s	Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten 	b
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;	s	Into hopeless, endless mourning. 	b
But yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest	s	All those disturbed waves decrease 	b
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.	s	Stern duty stores for me. 	b
I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,	s	Every leaf speaks bliss to me, 	b
Although thou steal thee all my poverty;	s	That thou didst visit me? 	b
And yet, love knows, it is a greater grief	s	Though it roar in thunder wild, 	b
To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury.	s	Tears have left ghastly traces there, 	b
Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,	s	I AM the only being whose doom 	b
Those petty wrongs that liberty commits,	s	And doubly will the dark world grieve me, 	b
When I am sometime absent from thy heart,	s	Fast asleep and almost dying, 	b
Thy beauty and thy years full well befits,	s	Are brushing off the scented dew, 	b
For still temptation follows where thou art.	s	Must always end in gloom ; 	b
Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,	s	Midnight moonlight's holy shrine. 	b
Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed;	s	It closes with a tomb ! 	b
And when a woman woos, what woman's son	s	From thought of grief are free. 	b
Will sourly leave her till she have prevailed?	s	Danger, and guilt, and darkness lie, 	b
Ay me! but yet thou mightest my seat forbear,	s	Weary to watch the spirit languish 	b
And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,	s	Through years of dead despair. 	b
Who lead thee in their riot even there	s	So, if a tear, when thou art dying, 	b
Or made them swear against the thing they see;	s	Since I beheld another dwelling. 	b
Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,	s	When I am not, and none beside, 	b
That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,	s	For wild those gusts, and well their chimes 	b
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;	s	That cold departure pictures mine. 	b
A loss in love that touches me more nearly.	s	My deadliest pains might die ; 	b
Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:	s	False she was, and unrelenting ; 	b
Within be fed, without be rich no more:	s	Seems it not that eve's declining 	b
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,	s	Of dastard treachery ? 	b
Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.	s	Though comet-like its course was run ; 	b
If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,	s	As wise, to mourn the seed which grew 	b
And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;	s	Upon her dying mind, 	b
Both find each other, and I lose both twain,	s	Its gentle ray cannot control 	b
And both for my sake lay on me this cross:	s	It comes at last to cancel time, 	b
But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;	s	Which since this morn laid many low ; 	b
Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.	s	Around me, wretches uttering praise, 	b
When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,	s	Or howling o'er their hopeless days, 	b
But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,	s	It breathed from its heart invisible. 	b
And darkly bright are bright in dark directed.	s	A brotherhood of misery, 	b
I guess one angel in another's hell:	s	That it quenches e'en now the vital spark, 	b
To the clear day with thy much clearer light,	s	Whose madness daily maddened me, 	b
By looking on thee in the living day,	s	Arouse thee from thy dreams I 	b
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade	s	Escape earth's dungeon tomb ? 	b
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!	s	But only give me back my tears, 	b
All days are nights to see till I see thee,	s	What seems the vilest, even like thine 	b
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.	s	As if to invite the smiling skies ; 	b
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,	s	Of seraph's song, and demon's moan ; 	b
Injurious distance should not stop my way;	s	In concord with her reddening cheek. 	b
For then despite of space I would be brought,	s	As sculptured marble saint, or slumbering un- 	b
Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,	s	And far away in woody dell 	b
Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;	s	I stole away from crowds and light 	b
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land	s	There like a wild beast turns he back, 	b
As soon as think the place where he would be.	s	Lavished glory on that second May ! 	b
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,	s	The mortal strife that then befell ; 	b
But that so much of earth and water wrought	s	And yet a little longer speak, 	b
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,	s	4 Yet moved she not ; she only raised 	b
Receiving nought by elements so slow	s	An earnest grief a strong desire 	b
But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.	s	The city's murmur softly blends 	b
The other two, slight air and purging fire,	s	That we must long till life be done ; 	b
Are both with thee, wherever I abide;	s	As thick as morning's tears ; 	b
The first my thought, the other my desire,	s	That heaven which my sweet lover's brow 	b
These present-absent with swift motion slide.	s	His frequent sighs, long-drawn and deep, 	b
Am of myself, all tyrant, for thy sake?	s	And Love I laugh to scorn ; 	b
In tender embassy of love to thee,	s	Could I have seen my country smile ? 	b
My life, being made of four, with two alone	s	A hundred fights for them ! 	b
Until life's composition be recured	s	Little moss-rose, cease to weep, 	b
By those swift messengers return'd from thee,	s	Their cruel strife may close ; 	b
Who even but now come back again, assured	s	Will tread its labyrinths alone. 	b
Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:	s	Oh, thy sweet tongue must plead for me 	b
This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,	s	Yes, as my swift days near their goal, 	b
I send them back again and straight grow sad.	s	'Tis all that I implore ; 	b
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war	s	In life and death a chainless soul, 	b
How to divide the conquest of thy sight;	s	And oh ! above the best of those 	b
Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,	s	If ranks beneath the cannon fall, 	b
My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.	s	I repent not that which my hand has done 	b
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie--	s	And I can sing and I can smile, 	b
A closet never pierced with crystal eyes--	s	Alike, while I have holiday. 	b
But the defendant doth that plea deny	s	Where wilt thou go, my harassed heart 	b
And says in him thy fair appearance lies.	s	To aid a spirit lost in crime, 	b
To 'cide this title is impanneled	s	What spot, or near or far apart, 	b
The clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part:	s	Lights me till my life is done ; 	b
As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,	s	There is a spot, 'mid barren hills, 	b
And my heart's right thy inward love of heart.	s	And high its arched windows rise, 	b
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,	s	The last full cup of triumph drink, 	b
And each doth good turns now unto the other:	s	Nor yet the ocean's wave. 	b
When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,	s	Bring good in rising, leave peace in decline, 	b
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,	s	Sighed at first, but sighed not long ; 	b
With my love's picture then my eye doth feast	s	Grows as green in April rain, 	b
And to the painted banquet bids my heart;	s	One glance revealed how little care 	b
Another time mine eye is my heart's guest	s	The mute bird sitting on the stone, 	b
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:	s	I was not tired, my darling one, 	b
So, either by thy picture or my love,	s	I saw to-day my enemy. 	b
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,	s	For ever present to my eye, 	b
And I am still with them and they with thee;	s	My worn heart throbs so wildly 	b
Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight	s	The alien firelight died away ; 	b
Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,	s	And seen in mist and moonlit stone, 	b
How careful was I, when I took my way,	s	I am speaking of a later stroke, 	b
Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,	s	But mine sank sad and low ! 	b
That to my use it might unused stay	s	And all do homage to their will, 	b
From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!	s	A distant, dreamy, dim blue chain 	b
But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,	s	And when I laughed they all replied ; 	b
Most worthy of comfort, now my greatest grief,	s	'Till the dread burst breaks forth once more 	b
Thou, best of dearest and mine only care,	s	So sweet, so soft, so hushed an air ; 	b
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?	s	And as blithely as of yore 	b
Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,	s	When the pen that motto drew. 	b
Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,	s	But long lies the dew on its crimson leaves, 	b
In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;	s	Up rose he, and stretched forth his hand, 	b
From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;	s	And revelled in my changeful dreams, 	b
And even thence thou wilt be stol'n, I fear,	s	Marked out the tracks of wandering sheep. 	b
For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.	s	Of each dark night and dim, beclouded day. 	b
Against that time, if ever that time come,	s	I gazed within thine earnest eyes 	b
When I shall see thee frown on my defects,	s	Brought to earth the fluttering game : 	b
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,	s	Restraint and heavy task recoil. 	b
Call'd to that audit by advised respects;	s	The vault, whose grated eye showed heaven more 	b
A dateless lively heat, still to endure,	s	Who spend too soon their youthful day. 	b
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.	s	The common paths that others run ; 	b
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,	s	That centre all the joys of years. 	b
Shall reasons find of settled gravity,--	s	That waves in summer air : 	b
Against that time do I ensconce me here	s	Wears not a cloud that speaks of gloom. 	b
Within the knowledge of mine own desert,	s	To soothe my spirit's care. 	b
And this my hand against myself uprear,	s	From morning's faintest dawning 	b
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:	s	Begilt with tasselled cords of gold, 	b
To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,	s	Wilt thou prove faithless now ? 	b
Since why to love I can allege no cause.	s	I 'd fling the brand in the hissing sea, 	b
How heavy do I journey on the way,	s	So often to the unopened door? 	b
When what I seek, my weary travel's end,	s	Have sought one gleam of mercy there ! 	b
Doth teach that ease and that repose to say	s	Across the mountain stream. 	b
Why so large cost, having so short a lease,	s	A few years of captivity, 	b
The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,	s	And ice upon the glancing stream 	b
Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,	s	You 've tracked me to a lonely spot. 	b
As if by some instinct the wretch did know	s	Earth's wilderness was round me spread, 	b
His rider loved not speed, being made from thee:	s	And night obscure his way ; 	b
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on	s	Mysterious it rose from the billowy moor. 	b
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide;	s	Because they have no stay but thine. 	b
Which heavily he answers with a groan,	s	With thunder volleys rolling on before 	b
More sharp to me than spurring to his side;	s	The sting of anguish drear/ 	b
For that same groan doth put this in my mind;	s	Re-echo back again. 	b
My grief lies onward and my joy behind.	s	'Tis better far away ; 	b
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence	s	They who have been our life, our soul, 	b
Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:	s	Geraldine, wilt thou delay? 	b
From where thou art why should I haste me thence?	s	For, oh ! when chill the sunbeams fall 	b
Till I return, of posting is no need.	s	My soul, another love. 	b
O, what excuse will my poor beast then find,	s	Following the bend of Aspin's side, 	b
When swift extremity can seem but slow?	s	But, if there be a God above, 	b
Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind;	s	The whole devoured and lost in death ! 	b
In winged speed no motion shall I know:	s	Ere evening far away. 	b
Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;	s	I could think in the withered grass 	b
But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade;	s	The loving spirit lingers long, 	b
Since from thee going he went wilful-slow,	s	I turned me from that young saint's bed 	b
Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,	s	Through th' autumnal sky ; 	b
The which he will not every hour survey,	s	I watch this cloudy evening fall, 	b
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.	s	For whom his spirit unforgiven 	b
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,	s	Sweet voices in the halls resound, 	b
Since, seldom coming, in the long year set,	s	Did my exiled spirit grieve. 	b
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,	s	O no, it was not this ! 	b
Or captain jewels in the carcanet.	s	'Tis the last line of the woeful song ; 	b
So is the time that keeps you as my chest,	s	My tortured limbs in dungeons bind, 	b
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,	s	' It was spring, and the skylark was singing * ; 	b
To make some special instant special blest,	s	With a solemn, plaintive sound. 	b
By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.	s	And waken unavailing tears. 	b
Blessed are you, whose worthiness gives scope,	s	Nor absence, nor distance can quell. 	b
What is your substance, whereof are you made,	s	And lonely I am pining, 	b
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?	s	They uttered the music of May ; 	b
Since every one hath, every one, one shade,	s	Far less when evening's pensive hour 	b
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,	s	To that deep and swelling river 	b
Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit	s	While thy heart suffers there. 	b
Is poorly imitated after you;	s	And there were garments spread, 	b
On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,	s	No ten can deal such deadly misery 	b
And you in Grecian tires are painted new:	s	To walk by the hill-torrent's side ! 	b
Speak of the spring and foison of the year;	s	It is swelled with the first snowy weather ; 	b
The one doth shadow of your beauty show,	s	The rocks they are icy and hoar, 	b
The other as your bounty doth appear;	s	Arthur, brother, we returned 	b
And you in every blessed shape we know.	s	Fierce grew Rosina's gloomy gaze ; 	b
In all external grace you have some part,	s	There are no yellow stars on the mountain ; 	b
But you like none, none you, for constant heart.	s	'Tis here 'tis there, 'tis nowhere oh ! my soul, 	b
O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem	s	Gaze not so earnestly upon 	b
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!	s	Leagues on leagues are left behind 	b
The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem	s	But lovelier than corn-fields all waving 	b
For that sweet odour which doth in it live.	s	All thy cold and scornful pride, 	b
The canker-blooms have full as deep a dye	s	My spirit drank a mingled tone, 	b
If it be not, then love doth well denote	s	I would have dreary weather, 	b
Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly	s	'Tis thus that human minds will turn, 	b
When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:	s	And envied such despair. 	b
But, for their virtue only is their show,	s	I paused, confounded and distracted, 	b
My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,	s	A lip of cruel scorn ; 	b
Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;	s	To where those signal lights are burning, 	b
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:	s	And swift were the wings to our feet given, 	b
And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,	s	Their brows are unshadowed, undimmed by woe. 	b
When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.	s	What sudden power the fancy hath 	b
Not marble, nor the gilded monuments	s	That vision of a mighty host 	b
Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;	s	And this shall be my dream to-night ; 	b
Than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time.	s	I shall be a dream to thee. 	b
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,	s	For the moors, where the linnet was trilling 	b
And broils root out the work of masonry,	s	My present entity ! 	b
Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn	s	Within itself may tell ! 	b
The living record of your memory.	s	And fair it budded day by day 	b
'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity	s	His features in the wave. 	b
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room	s	Yawned in the city's reeling wall, 	b
Even in the eyes of all posterity	s	On the brow of a lonely hill kneeling, 	b
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.	s	In my Redeemer's name 	b
So, till the judgment that yourself arise,	s	And proud its mighty columns show 	b
You live in this, and dwell in lover's eyes.	s	It feels no sympathy 	b
Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said	s	I hurried down the dark oak stair ; 	b
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,	s	When I was hardly six years old, 	b
Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,	s	But not the loved music, whose waking 	b
To-morrow sharpen'd in his former might:	s	No fear of grief in her bright eyes should quiver ; 	b
Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness,	s	In frozen mist arrayed. 	b
To-morrow see again, and do not kill	s	Sweet land of light ! Thy children fair 	b
The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness.	s	A mutual immortality. 	b
Let this sad interim like the ocean be	s	And sprang up to a glorious birth 	b
Which parts the shore, where two contracted new	s	Needst thou then dissemble sorrow, 	b
Come daily to the banks, that, when they see	s	Those tears had been heaven to me. 	b
Return of love, more blest may be the view;	s	Well well ; the sad minutes are moving, 	b
Else call it winter, which being full of care	s	Though loaded with trouble and pain ; 	b
Makes summer's welcome thrice more wish'd, more rare.	s	And some time the loved and the loving 	b
Being your slave, what should I do but tend	s	Shall meet on the mountains again I 	b
I have no precious time at all to spend,	s	How could I ask for pitying love, 	b
Nor services to do, till you require.	s	Thus to the man of sin he spoke : 	b
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour	s	ward votary, and to recall within his influence the proud mind 	b
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,	s	And murmur, summer-streams 	b
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour	s	Some nameless thing which hid not grace, 	b
When you have bid your servant once adieu;	s	She strikes it off with little care ; 	b
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought	s	Shall nature cease to bow ? 	b
Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,	s	From such a lethargy ? 	b
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep	s	Whose streets stretch round so ceaselessly. 	b
So true a fool is love that in your will,	s	O do not think that God can leave, 	b
Though you do any thing, he thinks no ill.	s	Subdued both grief and passion wild. 	b
That god forbid that made me first your slave,	s	Loud was the sudden gust of woe 	b
I should in thought control your times of pleasure,	s	A burdened heart I bear, 	b
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,	s	' Because, I hoped while they enjoyed, 	b
To me that languish'd for her sake;	s	This shadow should night's welcome be ; 	b
O, let me suffer, being at your beck,	s	When wounded he wins to the darkest wood, 	b
The imprison'd absence of your liberty;	s	Sinks from the summer sky, 	b
And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,	s	To watch through all eternity, 	b
Without accusing you of injury.	s	And then a captive's tomb. 	b
Be where you list, your charter is so strong	s	My ear drank his dying sigh. 	b
That you yourself may privilege your time	s	But check those coward sobs, and bring 	b
To what you will; to you it doth belong	s	And keep it still divine 	b
Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.	s	Though burning thoughts that spurn control, 	b
I am to wait, though waiting so be hell;	s	That thy dear blood was poured in vain.' 	b
For, thou betraying me, I do betray	s	Then art thou not my golden June, 	b
If there be nothing new, but that which is	s	Yet few would ask a heaven 	b
Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,	s	More like this earth than thine. 	b
Which, labouring for invention, bear amiss	s	Then let my winds caress thee ; 	b
The second burden of a former child!	s	But what will winter bring? 	b
O, that record could with a backward look,	s	Must first be utterly forgot. 	b
Even of five hundred courses of the sun,	s	And earthly change from pain to pain, 	b
Show me your image in some antique book,	s	HERE again is the same mind in converse with a like 	b
To this composed wonder of your frame;	s	Rank, beauty, wealth, and power combine 	b
Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,	s	Halos ! O far too bright to shine 	b
To subjects worse have given admiring praise.	s	The opening sea seemed smooth at last ; 	b
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,	s	A cloudless moon shone through 	b
So do our minutes hasten to their end;	s	* Nay, rather, Gondal's shaken throne 	b
Each changing place with that which goes before,	s	* Douglas, he pleaded bitterly, 	b
In sequent toil all forwards do contend.	s	I need not sink beneath my woes ; 	b
Nativity, once in the main of light,	s	And yet, through every magic change, 	b
Crooked elipses 'gainst his glory fight,	s	The young and aged tree, 	b
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.	s	Her forehead, drooped like lily pale. 	b
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth	s	I needed not its breathing 	b
And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,	s	Her children are rank and her kingdom's spread far. 	b
Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,	s	For him no tear his stern eye shed 	b
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:	s	How dark the woods will be ! 	b
And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,	s	4 The thick leaves in my murmur 	b
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet	s	It breaks upon the awful roar 	b
Is it thy will thy image should keep open	s	The time of grace is past, 	b
My heavy eyelids to the weary night?	s	' Well, since it must be told, Lady, 	b
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,	s	Thy perished faith shall spring to life, 	b
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?	s	The ringlets of his long black hair 	b
Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee	s	Over the Eden of his soul ; 	b
So far from home into my deeds to pry,	s	Love, and its own life, had power to keep it 	b
To find out shames and idle hours in me,	s	All round the hot and glaring sky 	b
O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:	s	That dearest boon was given ; 	b
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake;	s	In their own course to flow.' 	b
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,	s	Evince my gratitude ! 	b
To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.	s	Oh no ; these brighter visions vast 	b
To entertain the time with thoughts of love,	s	IN MEMORY OF 	b
From me far off, with others all too near.	s	' 1 '11 win thee 'gainst thy will. 	b
Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye	s	Ere his quivering limbs, all foam-flecked, 	b
And all my soul and all my every part;	s	They say, ' Zalona celebrates 	b
And for this sin there is no remedy,	s	For Nature's sad reality, 	b
It is so grounded inward in my heart.	s	And on its green bank, bathed in gore, 	b
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,	s	Have slaves subdued the free? 	b
No shape so true, no truth of such account;	s	Beneath the church-aisle stone, 	b
And for myself mine own worth do define,	s	And Truth may rudely trample down 	b
As I all other in all worths surmount.	s	And thou for being alone.' 	b
But when my glass shows me myself indeed,	s	lut dreary, strange, and pale and cold. 	b
Beated and chopp'd with tann'd antiquity,	s	It tumbled in an inky sea. 	b
Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;	s	which it is stayed. 	b
Self so self-loving were iniquity.	s	' AYE there it is ! it wakes to-night 	b
Do I not think on thee, when I forgot	s	Deep feelings I thought dead ; 	b
Painting my age with beauty of thy days.	s	That lulling monotone did sing 	b
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,	s	To cover deeds untrue, 	b
When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow	s	My lonely years had known. 	b
With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn	s	And by thine eyes' full gaze, 	b
Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night,	s	And by the words thou scarce dost speak, 	b
And all those beauties whereof now he's king	s	The anguish in my breast, 	b
Are vanishing or vanish'd out of sight,	s	Besides the mist is half withdrawn, 	b
Stealing away the treasure of his spring;	s	The moon of summer pours 	b
For such a time do I now fortify	s	I weary for that land divine, 	b
But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,	s	O'er each familiar tower. 	b
That he shall never cut from memory	s	1 It is hope's spell that glorifies, 	b
This brand she quenched in a cool well by,	s	That welled from mortal grief, I knew 	b
Two loves I have of comfort and despair,	s	I HAVE gone backward in the work, 	b
And they shall live, and he in them still green.	s	The whisper of its fall : 	b
When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced	s	But those were in the early glow 	b
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;	s	From thine own influence free ; 	b
But since he died and poets better prove,	s	That clay he feels will not for ever 	b
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;	s	Come, leave thy dwelling dark and cold, 	b
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain	s	1 Thus truly, when that breast is cold, 	b
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,	s	Thy prisoned soul shall rise ; 	b
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?	s	The dungeon mingle with the mould 	b
Increasing store with loss and loss with store;	s	Dire region of most mighty woe, 	b
When I have seen such interchange of state,	s	And is her mirror broke at last 	b
No matter then although my foot did stand	s	Quietly fed in grassy dells ; 	b
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,	s	One glimpse of that unearthly form 	b
That Time will come and take my love away.	s	It treads a forest wide, 	b
Those that can see thou lovest, and I am blind.	s	The ardent, and the happy breast, 	b
But weep to have that which it fears to lose.	s	The sullen clouds lay all unbroken 	b
Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,	s	And though its wind repining grieved, 	b
There is such strength and warrantize of skill	s	For ever on my heart ! 	b
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,	s	The holly is dark when the rose-brier blooms, 	b
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?	s	Hopes quenched, and rising thoughts subdued, 	b
O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out	s	* And hope can hardly deck the cheek 	b
When rocks impregnable are not so stout,	s	And in the zenith of his fame 	b
Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?	s	And just like his its ringlets bright, 	b
Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,	s	Oppressive mystery hung ; 	b
With insufficiency my heart to sway?	s	Though wasted sore with sorrow, 	b
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?	s	What do these brazen tongues proclaim ? 	b
On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon?	s	One task alone remains thy pictured face to view, 	b
Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,	s	THE ELDER'S REBUKE 	b
That in black ink my love may still shine bright.	s	For nothing nearer paradise 	b
As, to behold desert a beggar born,	s	Yes, by the tears I Ve poured, 	b
And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,	s	Kneeling on the blood-stained heath 	b
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,	s	Watch life's bubbles float away : 	b
And guilded honour shamefully misplaced,	s	To rouse its flickering radiance higher ; 	b
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,	s	Comes on the increasing roar ! 	b
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,	s	Oh, in the days of ardent youth 	b
And strength by limping sway disabled,	s	Their dark, their deadly ray would more than 	b
And art made tongue-tied by authority,	s	Where that perished sapling used to be ; 	b
And folly doctor-like controlling skill,	s	Remembrance of his early home 	b
And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,	s	Pondered and approved at last : 	b
And captive good attending captain ill:	s	Thank the power that banished thee ; 	b
Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,	s	* Glorious is the prize of Duty, 	b
Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.	s	Are quenched in morning dull and grey? 	b
Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,	s	Thy comrades to the camp retire ; 	b
And with his presence grace impiety,	s	Rests such a shade of deep despair, 	b
That sin by him advantage should achieve	s	Youth's early sunshine was poured on his 	b
And lace itself with his society?	s	She sat without the grated den, 	b
Why should false painting imitate his cheek	s	A winter's night. 	b
And steal dead seeing of his living hue?	s	Heedless feet to gulfs of crime. 	b
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek	s	For those whose bodies rest in sleep, 	b
Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?	s	That from which it sprung Eternity. 	b
Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,	s	When stealing on to lady's bower, 	b
Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?	s	With looks and smiles divine ! 	b
And, proud of many, lives upon his gains.	s	Far down from heaven its silver flood 	b
O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had	s	That wherever I wander, my heart is with thee. 	b
In days long since, before these last so bad.	s	4 The lays I love so well.' 	b
Being had, to triumph, being lack'd, to hope.	s	Virtue is not won by fears.' 	b
Before the bastard signs of fair were born,	s	Thoughts shut within the silent tomb, 	b
Or durst inhabit on a living brow;	s	So would I fearful vigil keep, 	b
Before the golden tresses of the dead,	s	To send to hell my mortal foe. 	b
The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,	s	Walked by the lightsome touch of pleasure : 	b
To live a second life on second head;	s	Had he ne'er met a gentler teacher, 	b
Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:	s	I saw the burning sunshine fall, 	b
In him those holy antique hours are seen,	s	In his most burning mood ; 	b
Without all ornament, itself and true,	s	Heavy and dull as lead. 	b
Making no summer of another's green,	s	Might haply dawn above ; 	b
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;	s	Brenzaida's crest is down ; 	b
And him as for a map doth Nature store,	s	To leave its clay a little while, 	b
To show false Art what beauty was of yore.	s	Can take the bliss that has been given, 	b
Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view	s	True to myself, and true to all, 	b
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;	s	It was not hope that wrecked at once 	b
All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,	s	That never would cloud the world of day. 	b
Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.	s	The cold corpse from its funeral pall, 	b
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;	s	A glorious child again ; 	b
But those same tongues that give thee so thine own	s	And draw his tired gaze from futurity ? 	b
In other accents do this praise confound	s	And black the piles of rain-clouds lour 	b
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.	s	That glory-shedding star shall glow 	b
They look into the beauty of thy mind,	s	Where sinless sunshine lay : 	b
Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,	s	So softly evening blends with night, 	b
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,	s	And seek a rough and lonely way ; 	b
But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,	s	First melted off the hope of youth, 	b
The solve is this, that thou dost common grow.	s	Nor mirth, nor music wakes my halls. 	b
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,	s	They whispered nought, but, ' Lady, sleep, 	b
And all my honest faith in thee is lost,	s	When it bears my slumbering child. 	b
The ornament of beauty is suspect,	s	Strikes the strings resistlesslyt 	b
A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.	s	The deep-down sea with sudden sound 	b
So thou be good, slander doth but approve	s	Calm this resentful mood ; 	b
Thy worth the greater, being woo'd of time;	s	Darkening all my summer skies, 	b
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,	s	For well he knew what dangers frowned, 	b
And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.	s	All full of God thy features shine. 	b
Thou hast pass'd by the ambush of young days,	s	The glad birds carolled clear ; 	b
My love is as a fever, longing still	s	Between his port and him. 	b
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,	s	My name is on a million tongues, 	b
If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,	s	And nothing but that agony 	b
Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.	s	In daisied lawns sleep peacefully, 	b
No longer mourn for me when I am dead	s	And solemn, soothing, softened airs, 	b
Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell	s	* Others have been thou mayst be there. ' 	b
Give warning to the world that I am fled	s	Incline thee to my changeful will, 	b
From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:	s	Thank the power that made thee part 	b
Nay, if you read this line, remember not	s	Because I could not save. 	b
The hand that writ it; for I love you so	s	It recks not now, when all is over : 	b
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot	s	The woodland park around it spread, 	b
If thinking on me then should make you woe.	s	A mourner still, though friend and lover 	b
O, if, I say, you look upon this verse	s	And there it lightens ! Dashed with gore 	b
When I perhaps compounded am with clay,	s	We would not leave our nature home 	b
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.	s	As if through all the 'wildering maze 	b
But let your love even with my life decay,	s	Time parts the heart of men. 	b
Lest the wise world should look into your moan	s	' Dearest, ever deem me true ' ; 	b
I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,	s	And makes the shout of victory 	b
O, lest the world should task you to recite	s	Remoter still am I from Thee j 	b
What merit lived in me, that you should love	s	And on a strange road journeyed on, 	b
After my death, dear love, forget me quite,	s	might my eyes with tears run o'er ! 	b
For you in me can nothing worthy prove;	s	And makes me strong to undergo 	b
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,	s	But cold cold is that resting-place, 	b
You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.	s	Saw those tokens on the ground. 	b
And hang more praise upon deceased I	s	And dear to me, aye doubly dear, 	b
Than niggard truth would willingly impart:	s	O'er bower and trees that orb divine 	b
O, lest your true love may seem false in this,	s	Thy eternal Justice found ! 	b
That you for love speak well of me untrue,	s	And sworn friends fall from me : 	b
My name be buried where my body is,	s	A memory whose blighting beam 	b
And live no more to shame nor me nor you.	s	The fate was cruel which bore 	b
For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,	s	To see her cheek's returning glow ; 	b
And so should you, to love things nothing worth.	s	I saw her stand in the gallery long, 	b
That time of year thou mayst in me behold	s	Sleep on ; Heaven laughs above, 	b
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang	s	A noble victory you shall sing 	b
Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.	s	He almost deemed, might have throbbed again 	b
Doth follow night, who like a fiend	s	Part human company ; 	b
As after sunset fadeth in the west,	s	And render up life's tiresome load. 	b
Which by and by black night doth take away,	s	That by the death of my dearest treasures 	b
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.	s	Through the wan autumnal sky ; 	b
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire	s	I saw his hoof-prints mark the rock, 	b
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,	s	But this shall be the only time 	b
As the death-bed whereon it must expire	s	I can tear my soul from its mould of clay, 	b
Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.	s	Hush its whispers in your breast ; 	b
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,	s	1 should be where I wish to be. 	b
To love that well which thou must leave ere long.	s	Crushed helpless into earth and Dust ! 	b
But be contented: when that fell arrest	s	Full many an eye watched over me, 	b
Without all bail shall carry me away,	s	Does sudden silence chill the room ? 	b
My life hath in this line some interest,	s	My whole heart centred there ; 	b
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.	s	If you forget the sacred vows 	b
When thou reviewest this, thou dost review	s	Then let me not despair ; 	b
The very part was consecrate to thee:	s	Such as their lips could only pour, 	b
The earth can have but earth, which is his due;	s	Beneath whose noble dome 	b
My spirit is thine, the better part of me:	s	Have anchored safe, and rest at last 	b
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,	s	His dark, keen eyes on Percy gaze 	b
The prey of worms, my body being dead,	s	Gone ! 'tis a word which through life's troubled 	b
The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,	s	Say how long my sleep has been ? 	b
The worth of that is that which it contains,	s	Has warmed and blest me long : 	b
And that is this, and this with thee remains.	s	Would bring its after-storm of pain. 	b
Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;	s	Shall set my spirit free, 	b
And for the peace of you I hold such strife	s	And nerved, like mine, to kill ; 	b
As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found;	s	The elm-tree by the haunted well 	b
Now proud as an enjoyer and anon	s	THE LADY TO HER GUITAR 	b
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,	s	And green light slept on the happy earth, 	b
Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure;	s	I know our souls are all divine, 	b
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight	s	To wander far away ; 	b
And by and by clean starved for a look;	s	It is stilled above the slain. 	b
Possessing or pursuing no delight,	s	Sighing, mourning ever more. 	b
Save what is had or must from you be took.	s	And his fiery heart aroused panting. 	b
Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,	s	Nor hurt thy soul eternally. 	b
Or gluttoning on all, or all away.	s	Resounded far and near : 	b
Why is my verse so barren of new pride,	s	These ceaseless tears ! I wish their flow 	b
So far from variation or quick change?	s	This voice, though never heard before, 	b
Why with the time do I not glance aside	s	How little fraught with real ill, 	b
Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep	s	And we together sadly sank 	b
Why write I still all one, ever the same,	s	The earth as golden, green, and fair, 	b
And keep invention in a noted weed,	s	What joyous fete begun, 	b
Showing their birth and where they did proceed?	s	And cheerfully go out to play. 	b
O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,	s	HEAVY hangs the rain-drop 	b
And you and love are still my argument;	s	Pours black reproach on^me : 	b
So all my best is dressing old words new,	s	Exhaust thy life and hold thee here. 	b
Spending again what is already spent:	s	The reckless man would pray ; 	b
For as the sun is daily new and old,	s	Of his unquenched, unclouded blaze, 	b
So is my love still telling what is told.	s	* Her heart is beating,' Lesley said, 	b
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,	s	And heavy throbs the young heart 	b
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;	s	And then I go to prove if God, at least, be true ! 	b
In vowing new hate after new love bearing.	s	O'er wood and wold o'er flood and fell, 	b
And of this book this learning mayst thou taste.	s	The choking sob, the tortured moan. 	b
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show	s	I need not yield to care, 	b
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;	s	So lost that not a gleam may come. 	b
Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know	s	Frowning on the infant, 	b
Time's thievish progress to eternity.	s	Whose windows looked on the minster-yard, 	b
Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,	s	A bleak November's calm. 	b
Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find	s	That melancholy boy. 	b
These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,	s	GODS of the old mythology 	b
As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,	s	The stranger would not turn away, 	b
So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse	s	Long ere the poison-tainted air 	b
And found such fair assistance in my verse	s	Chasing angry thought away. 	b
And under thee their poesy disperse.	s	Where thou dost stand an hour ago, 	b
Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing	s	A deeper cup of bitterer pain ; 	b
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly	s	On golden summer's forests green, 	b
Have added feathers to the learned's wing	s	'Twas grief enough to think mankind 	b
And given grace a double majesty.	s	It might not be so drear, 	b
And by their verdict is determined	s	Has never wooed to blow, 	b
Whose influence is thine and born of thee:	s	Scentless are thy petals, 	b
In others' works thou dost but mend the style,	s	Can watch the lustre leave its skies 	b
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;	s	The cannon with unceasing crash 	b
But thou art all my art and dost advance	s	Not one voice sobs * farewell ' ; 	b
As high as learning my rude ignorance.	s	Barren is thy beauty, 	b
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,	s	So heaven's sun shines in thee. 	b
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,	s	Forget, forsake, refuse to hear ! 	b
But now my gracious numbers are decay'd	s	You both were vainly given : 	b
He is contented thy poor drudge to be,	s	I saw the light decay. 	b
I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument	s	YET o'er his face a solemn light 	b
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?	s	Stanzas 5 and 6 have been crossed out in the manuscript. 	b
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent	s	From trampling on thy buried breast. 	b
He robs thee of and pays it thee again.	s	And bounding down the marble stair. 	b
He lends thee virtue and he stole that word	s	That none can pass again. 	b
From thy behavior; beauty doth he give	s	His banners all bravely flying ; 	b
And found it in thy cheek; he can afford	s	And cheered his host by adding stern 	b
No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.	s	Why, Seraph, has thine erring wing 	b
Then thank him not for that which he doth say,	s	Wafted thee down to weep with him ? 	b
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,	s	IT *s over now ; I Ve known it all ; 	b
And in the praise thereof spends all his might,	s	Nor do I come to mingle tears ; 	b
To make me tongue-tied, speaking of your fame!	s	But sweet is day, though with shadows 	b
But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,	s	To feel the frost-wind blow ! 	b
Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.	s	Yet the grass before the door 	b
That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.	s	But never more look up and see 	b
On your broad main doth wilfully appear.	s	Her darling child from her embrace 	b
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,	s	Will then like virtues shine ; 	b
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;	s	* Heavy and dark the night is closing ; 	b
Or being wreck'd, I am a worthless boat,	s	Heavy and dark may its bidding be : 	b
He of tall building and of goodly pride:	s	May I never tread the hills again. 	b
Then if he thrive and I be cast away,	s	Or how in exile misery 	b
The worst was this; my love was my decay.	s	' Watch in love by a fevered pillow, 	b
Or I shall live your epitaph to make,	s	When heaven repels my prayer, 	b
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;	s	Safe as the petrel on tossing billow, 	b
Although in me each part will be forgotten.	s	Like summer's sunshine o'er a hill, 	b
Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:	s	( Guardian-angel he lacks no longer ; 	b
The earth can yield me but a common grave,	s	From his last hopeless agony, 	b
When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.	s	Eclipsed the glory of the sky, 	b
Your monument shall be my gentle verse,	s	And my love is truer than angel-care.' 	b
Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,	s	And all the joyous music breathing by, 	b
And tongues to be your being shall rehearse	s	The place, the hour the same ; 	b
When all the breathers of this world are dead;	s	How canst thou linger now ? 	b
You still shall live--such virtue hath my pen--	s	And stars were in the depth of blue, 	b
Triumph in love; flesh stays no father reason;	s	'Tis true she stands among the crowd, 	b
And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook	s	Even so, Guitar, thy magic tone 	b
The dedicated words which writers use	s	The little lamp burns straight, its rays shoot 	b
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,	s	And wept above thy fate the more 	b
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,	s	Flung streaks of moonshine here and there. 	b
And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.	s	Your eyelids droop, a weight is on your brow ; 	b
And therefore art enforced to seek anew	s	Woe to the gifted, crime to the giver, 	b
Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days	s	And singing birds and sighing trees, 	b
And do so, love; yet when they have devised	s	And dim the hearts that slowly die. 	b
What strained touches rhetoric can lend,	s	Spent in her Eden Isle 	b
Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized	s	Passed with the ray whose shine it caught ; 	b
In true plain words by thy true-telling friend;	s	What loves me, no word of mine shall e'er betray, 	b
And their gross painting might be better used	s	When, severed wide by guiltless gore, 	b
Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused.	s	And all their myriad voices 	b
And therefore to your fair no painting set;	s	I heard it then, you heard it too, 	b
I found, or thought I found, you did exceed	s	He for whom I wait, thus ever comes to me ; 	b
The barren tender of a poet's debt;	s	Strange Power ! I trust thy might ; trust thou my 	b
And therefore have I slept in your report,	s	Looks from its golden frame ; 	b
That you yourself being extant well might show	s	And that wide west has waked a word 	b
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:	s	But listen ! The earth is our campaign of war, 	b
Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.	s	Whose sombre portal hides the light, 	b
This silence for my sin you did impute,	s	Clings Percy's wounded spirit so : 	b
Which shall be most my glory, being dumb;	s	I shall not tread again the deep glens where it 	b
For I impair not beauty being mute,	s	The narrow dungeon of the dead, 	b
When others would give life and bring a tomb.	s	A silence settled on the room, 	b
There lives more life in one of your fair eyes	s	Across the waters of despair 	b
Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.	s	And quench the lamp and stir the fire, 	b
Who is it that says most? which can say more	s	Nor, through long hours of future pain, 	b
Than this rich praise, that you alone are you?	s	Her kind face o'er thee shine ? 	b
In whose confine immured is the store	s	Have wrapt the parent orb away. 	b
Which should example where your equal grew.	s	And give me liberty ! ' 	b
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell	s	Greets no returning summer skies ; 	b
That to his subject lends not some small glory;	s	But yet faint not, mournful man ; 	b
But he that writes of you, if he can tell	s	And from that world of heavenly light 	b
That you are you, so dignifies his story,	s	To guide us in our lifetime's night, 	b
Not making worse what nature made so clear,	s	Drowsy and dark my spirit lies, 	b
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,	s	But, ere night darkened down 	b
Making his style admired every where.	s	Thou wert so bright and fair, 	b
You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,	s	Yet could I with past pleasures 	b
Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.	s	With blue and ghostly gleams, 	b
While comments of your praise, richly compiled,	s	Remorse even now may wake within 	b
I think good thoughts whilst other write good words,	s	' Well there is rest there, 	b
To every hymn that able spirit affords	s	For there are angels weeping ; 	b
In polish'd form of well-refined pen.	s	The streets are crowded all, 	b
And to the most of praise add something more;	s	Our children felt their fathers' wretchedness ; 	b
But that is in my thought, whose love to you,	s	Its unsustaining vastness waxes drear ; 	b
Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.	s	And curb my own wild will. 	b
Then others for the breath of words respect,	s	True heart and brow unmarked by time, 	b
Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.	s	The law that bade it not defy. 	b
Bound for the prize of all too precious you,	s	And called on Heaven to aid 	b
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,	s	With such a fervent zeal, 	b
Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?	s	The clouded forms of long-past history. 	b
No, neither he, nor his compeers by night	s	It always walks with head declined, 	b
Giving him aid, my verse astonished.	s	It vexes me to choose another guide : 	b
That censures falsely what they see aright?	s	Their breasts have burst through the battle's 	b
Which have no correspondence with true sight!	s	Their ghostly fingers flecked with snow, 	b
I was not sick of any fear from thence:	s	What have those lonely mountains worth reveal- 	b
But when your countenance fill'd up his line,	s	But a wild bird sprang from his hidden lair, 	b
Then lack'd I matter; that enfeebled mine.	s	The earth that wakes one human heart to feeling 	b
Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,	s	Though time should change my youthful face, 	b
And like enough thou know'st thy estimate:	s	THE following are the last lines my sister Emily ever wrote. 	b
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;	s	No coward soul is mine, 	b
My bonds in thee are all determinate.	s	AND like myself lone, wholly lone, 	b
My soul doth tell my body that he may	s	I see Heaven's glories shine, 	b
But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought	s	He hears the stream its waters fling ; 	b
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,	s	I 'M standing in the forest now, 	b
And so my patent back again is swerving.	s	Almighty, ever-present Deity ! 	b
Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,	s	But a brave heart, with a tarnished name, 	b
So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,	s	The splendour of the main, 	b
Comes home again, on better judgment making.	s	They did not dare to smile. 	b
Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,	s	That move men's hearts : unutterably vain ; 	b
In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.	s	With windows yawning on intenser gloom, 	b
When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,	s	When thy stream was troubled, did mine calmly 	b
And place my merit in the eye of scorn,	s	The wind blew fresh and free. 	b
Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,	s	And forms and faces lost for ever 	b
And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.	s	A thousand dreams of mind. 	b
With mine own weakness being best acquainted,	s	The steadfast rock of immortality. 	b
Upon thy part I can set down a story	s	Or, with strained ear, to catch the shock, 	b
Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted,	s	MILD the mist upon the hill, 	b
That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:	s	Pervades and broods above, 	b
And I by this will be a gainer too;	s	Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates, and rears. 	b
Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;	s	Hath moved the tear and waked the sigh ; 	b
The injuries that to myself I do,	s	They kindled the perishing ember 	b
Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.	s	And Thou were left alone, 	b
Such is my love, to thee I so belong,	s	That love, which will the wicked greet 	b
That for thy right myself will bear all wrong.	s	The oath within that caverned hall, 	b
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,	s	And from the midst of cheerless gloom, 	b
And I will comment upon that offence;	s	One calm hour on the brink of life 	b
That follow'd it as gentle day	s	With thy mind's vision pierce the deep, 	b
Against thy reasons making no defence.	s	Eternal midnight there. 	b
My reason, the physician to my love,	s	OPPRESSED with sin and woe, 	b
To set a form upon desired change,	s	And madness cannot feel thy scorn, 	b
As I'll myself disgrace: knowing thy will,	s	I longed to view that bliss divine 	b
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,	s	And often when the sun declines 	b
Be absent from thy walks, and in my tongue	s	The ghastly night, the ghastlier morrow, 	b
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,	s	Her wavy hair on her shoulders bare, 	b
Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong	s	The burning tears that would keep welling, 	b
That every word doth almost tell my name,	s	That stains our standard green ? 	b
For thee against myself I'll vow debate,	s	Living in the depth of Heaven ; 	b
For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.	s	As if each gasp were life expelling, 	b
Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;	s	Like sudden ghosts, to memory came 	b
Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,	s	'Tis nothing to eternity : 	b
Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,	s	Mighty heaven, a glad avenger 	b
This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,	s	Death comes on every wind. 	b
Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scoped this sorrow,	s	That would not mourn the dead. 	b
Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;	s	Thickening above me evermore. 	b
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,	s	Has neared its final close, 	b
To linger out a purposed overthrow.	s	No tongue would ask, no eye would mourn ; 	b
If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,	s	But mutely trace its airy way, 	b
When other petty griefs have done their spite	s	At last refused to mourn. 	b
But in the onset come; so shall I taste	s	And summer days again begin 	b
At first the very worst of fortune's might,	s	Changing, and still the same, yet swiftly passing. 	b
And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,	s	The wild wind from that wavy main 	b
Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,	s	I never thought to see again. 	b
Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,	s	Bless thee, bright Sea, and glorious dome, 	b
Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill,	s	And thinks he of Patrician pride, 	b
Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;	s	My voice is choked, but not with grief, 	b
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,	s	Bright, but yet sullied, love which could never 	b
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:	s	I know my mountain breezes 	b
But these particulars are not my measure;	s	Deepened the gloom of evening's sky, 	b
All these I better in one general best.	s	And, were they forged in steel, they could not hold 	b
But when she saw my woeful state,	s	The long grass bending where I lay, 	b
Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,	s	And in the heath or mountain far 	b
Of more delight than hawks or horses be;	s	The goats fly by with timid cry, 	b
And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:	s	His golden days left long behind. 	b
Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take	s	But then it was a calmer woe, 	b
But being both from me, both to each friend,	s	'Tis many a year, 'tis long ago, 	b
But do thy worst to steal thyself away,	s	A dream of what had been before j 	b
For term of life thou art assured mine,	s	Was that in which the summer sheen 	b
And life no longer than thy love will stay,	s	Ungoverned nature madly spurned 	b
For it depends upon that love of thine.	s	Memory of feelings past, 	b
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,	s	Often I 've sat down on the ground, 	b
When in the least of them my life hath end.	s	Gazing up to the flush scarce seen, 	b
I see a better state to me belongs	s	Those bounding breasts that grief should thrill 	b
Than that which on thy humour doth depend;	s	Then died away, nor came again ; 	b
Suspect I may, but not directly tell;	s	Thy deep, unutterable woe? 	b
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.	s	But my sad heart must ever mourn 	b
O, what a happy title do I find,	s	It sought thy father's home and mine 	b
Happy to have thy love, happy to die!	s	As I remembered it of old. 	b
But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?	s	And dreamy scents of fragrance pass 	b
Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.	s	Come back the feelings that would swell, 	b
Like a deceived husband; so love's face	s	FAR away is the land of rest 	b
May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;	s	They would have done it had they known 	b
Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:	s	Oh ! I shall weary for the light 	b
For there can live no hatred in thine eye,	s	I howled, and tore my tangled hair ; 	b
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.	s	Time has turned the bloom to grey, 	b
In many's looks the false heart's history	s	Lay in unspeakable despair. 	b
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,	s	of New York in 1902. 	b
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.	s	Then 'twas first my nursling smiled ; 	b
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;	s	But both without a murmur there 	b
Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be,	s	But her father smiled on the fairest child 	b
How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,	s	WHAT winter floods, what streams of spring 	b
if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!	s	winds coldly mourn 	b
They that have power to hurt and will do none,	s	Dead, dead is my joy, 	b
That do not do the thing they most do show,	s	Might embrace in love again ; 	b
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,	s	To see that water shine ; 	b
Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,	s	But sighing it murmurs, * Let memory perish, 	b
They rightly do inherit heaven's graces	s	IN the same place, when nature wore 	b
And husband nature's riches from expense;	s	And nothing on the summer gale 	b
They are the lords and owners of their faces,	s	The dearest to a mountaineer 	b
Others but stewards of their excellence.	s	For, if your former words were true, 	b
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,	s	I cannot say my faith is strong, 	b
Though to itself it only live and die,	s	Now might we doubt God's guardian 	b
But if that flower with base infection meet,	s	Those wondrous southern Isles to hail, 	b
The basest weed outbraves his dignity:	s	Behold he sinks away ! 	b
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;	s	LORD of Elbe, on Elbe hill 	b
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.	s	The mist is thick and the wind is chill ; 	b
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame	s	More wakeful heart and eyelids grew. 	b
Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,	s	Has sighed for sorrow that thou wert away. 	b
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!	s	And in his hair the south wind blows, 	b
O, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!	s	And hopeless comes its dark decline, 	b
That tongue that tells the story of thy days,	s	Oh, we are listening for a sound, 	b
Making lascivious comments on thy sport,	s	Moans as the night gusts over it blow. 	b
Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;	s	Till each far-down reflection is 	b
When I perceive that men as plants increase,	s	I see them far off, and it deepens the gloom ; 	b
O, what a mansion have those vices got	s	An undefined, an awful dream, 	b
Which for their habitation chose out thee,	s	Where chill, chill whiteness covered all, 	b
Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,	s	In unexhausted woe. 	b
And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove	s	In darkness long concealed, 	b
Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;	s	Would now be tossing under me. 	b
The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.	s	I will not question, only say 	b
Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;	s	But thou art now on the desolate sea, 	b
Which like two spirits do suggest me still:	s	Regive him shadowy gleams of infancy 	b
Both grace and faults are loved of more and less;	s	Of love too warm, and wild, and bright. 	b
For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,	s	The Herons are flown to their trees by the Hall ; 	b
As on the finger of a throned queen	s	COLD, clear, and blue the morning heaven 	b
The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,	s	Will give me to a darker doom ; 	b
For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright,	s	Through a sky of cloudy grey. 	b
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,	s	Reflects that winter sky : 	b
If like a lamb he could his looks translate!	s	In glimpses of a spirit shore 	b
How many gazers mightst thou lead away,	s	A silent, silvery star. 	b
If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!	s	And I have long forgot to weep. 	b
As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.	s	Sweetly has its dawn begun ; 	b
How like a winter hath my absence been	s	But the heaven may shake with thunder 	b
From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!	s	Himself restored to infancy? 	b
What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!	s	To leave my lonely halls ! ' 	b
What old December's bareness every where!	s	Bless thee, bless all I cannot speak ; 	b
And yet this time removed was summer's time,	s	For the moon now beaming mild above 	b
The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,	s	Go, shed thy tears in Ocean's wave 	b
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,	s	From that wide heaven where every star 	b
Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:	s	IF grief for grief can touch thee, 	b
Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me	s	One hour, my spirit, stretch thy wings 	b
But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit;	s	Within their perfumed bower, 	b
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,	s	Of sorrows gathering near, 	b
And, thou away, the very birds are mute;	s	From her stately form and her features rare, 	b
Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer	s	And young leaves shoot among the fern. 	b
That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.	s	The twilight fading from the skies, 	b
From you have I been absent in the spring,	s	What ! shall they carve on his tomb with the sword 	b
How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made	s	How thou didst turn in mockery 	b
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,	s	Sparkling in sunshine and in dew, 	b
That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.	s	Had its waters worn the shore. 	b
Of different flowers in odour and in hue	s	Methinks the mellowing haze of years 	b
Could make me any summer's story tell,	s	No doubt had marr'd my word ; 	b
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew;	s	TELL me, tell me, smiling child, 	b
Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,	s	What the past is like to thee? 	b
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;	s	As glancing o'er the moorland track, 	b
Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.	s	Something in that ancestral pride 	b
Yet seem'd it winter still, and, you away,	s	Tell me what is the present hour? 	b
As with your shadow I with these did play:	s	A green and flowery spray, 	b
The forward violet thus did I chide:	s	Where a young bird sits gathering its power 	b
Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,	s	Your cold hands hardly hold the weary pen : 	b
If not from my love's breath? The purple pride	s	And what is the future, happy one? 	b
Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells	s	Sunk to peace the twilight breeze : 	b
And haply of our old acquaintance tell.	s	A mighty, glorious, dazzling sea, 	b
The lily I condemned for thy hand,	s	Stretching into infinity. 	b
And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair:	s	The inspiring music's thrilling sound, 	b
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,	s	No, Earth would wish no other sphere 	b
One blushing shame, another white despair;	s	The glittering splendour rising round, 	b
Straight in her heart did mercy come,	s	Yet of the native shepherds none, 	b
And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;	s	So stilly round the evening falls ; 	b
But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth	s	To keep my honour fair ; 	b
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.	s	Covering her brow to hide the tear 	b
Holds in perfection but a little moment,	s	The shepherd placed a seat and pressed 	b
But sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee.	s	From it the torrents flow ? 	b
Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long	s	Never put back that golden flow 	b
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?	s	That murmur to the breezes' call 	b
Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,	s	The laden bee flew home, 	b
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?	s	And raised the covering from his brow, 	b
Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem	s	* Nay, call me not ; it may not be ; 	b
In gentle numbers time so idly spent;	s	Still spoke to me of years gone by ; 	b
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem	s	Earth rising to heaven and heaven descending ; 	b
And gives thy pen both skill and argument.	s	Man's spirit away from the drear dungeon sending, 	b
If thy unworthiness raised love in me,	s	And sound and sight had well combined 	b
If any, be a satire to decay,	s	All down the mountain-sides wild forests lending 	b
And make Time's spoils despised every where.	s	The mighty voice to the life-giving wind ; 	b
Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life;	s	With dying torments riven 	b
So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.	s	Fast through the valleys a reckless course wending, 	b
O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends	s	The withering corpse to me. 	b
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?	s	The busy day has glided by, 	b
Both truth and beauty on my love depends;	s	For not through age, and not through crime, 	b
So dost thou too, and therein dignified.	s	Of the golden-gifted time ; 	b
They were but sweet, but figures of delight,	s	And, Douglas ! thou shalt be 	b
'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;	s	When my sad soul forgot its pride 	b
Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;	s	Since cast from off thine angel brow 	b
But best is best, if never intermix'd?'	s	Woods, you need not frown on me ; 	b
Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?	s	I have suffered on thro' night and day ; 	b
Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee	s	To know where she is laid. 	b
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,	s	You need not mock so bitterly. 	b
And to be praised of ages yet to be.	s	Thy silvery form, so soft and fair, 	b
Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how	s	I watched how evening took the place 	b
To make him seem long hence as he shows now.	s	And, far away, down Elmor scars 	b
My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;	s	* The birds that now so blithely sing, 	b
I love not less, though less the show appear:	s	And warms the breezy air. 	b
That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming	s	The waste of youth, the waste of years, 	b
The owner's tongue doth publish every where.	s	COME walk with me, 	b
When I was wont to greet it with my lays,	s	And still the words and still the tone 	b
As Philomel in summer's front doth sing	s	I dream of moor, and misty hill, 	b
Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,	s	In all the hours of gloom 	b
Not that the summer is less pleasant now	s	Will find a heart to bear. 	b
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,	s	WELL narrower draw the circle round, 	b
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,	s	Laid low in dust their Dryad-hair. 	b
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.	s	Through the long nights of angry weather, 	b
Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue,	s	When parted ghosts might come, 	b
Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand	s	Above their prisoned dust to grieve 	b
Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,	s	Its twilight hours and evenings dark 	b
That having such a scope to show her pride,	s	Whose waves are foaming far and wide. 	b
The argument all bare is of more worth	s	One gush of ardent prayer. 	b
O, blame me not, if I no more can write!	s	Forget the hopes of years : 	b
Look in your glass, and there appears a face	s	With the radiant red of furnace flames 	b
That over-goes my blunt invention quite,	s	Senselessly has lain. 	b
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.	s	To the discord of lute-strings all unstrung. 	b
Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,	s	My robes, and smooth my tangled hair ; 	b
To mar the subject that before was well?	s	And constant sorrow on my brow 	b
For to no other pass my verses tend	s	The saints shall shelter thee from harm. 	b
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;	s	And spread with smiles the evening meal ; 	b
Was used in giving gentle doom,	s	In years by time long left behind ; 	b
Your own glass shows you when you look in it.	s	TO A WREATH OF SNOW 	b
To me, fair friend, you never can be old,	s	When I began to pray. 	b
For as you were when first your eye I eyed,	s	And still it bent above, 	b
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold	s	They come sailing on, 	b
Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,	s	How oft have I forgot my God, 	b
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd	s	Yet my heart loves December's smile 	b
In process of the seasons have I seen,	s	That tracks the boundless blue. 	b
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,	s	Paints her image on the mind. 	b
Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,	s	Of gazing in thine eyes. 	b
Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;	s	And think the fearful vision o'er. 	b
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,	s	The blossoms to deck my home with the dead. 	b
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:	s	Tis like the heaven which parting days 	b
For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred;	s	The idol chiefs of all. 	b
Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.	s	As if grown weary of the light 	b
Let not my love be call'd idolatry,	s	When its lips opened and a sound 	b
Nor my beloved as an idol show,	s	Awoke the stillness reigning round, 	b
Since all alike my songs and praises be	s	Faint as a dream, but the earth shrank, 	b
To one, of one, still such, and ever so.	s	And truly like a god she seems, 	b
Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,	s	Woe for the day ! Regina's pride, 	b
Still constant in a wondrous excellence;	s	Retracing back her lifetime flown ; 	b
Therefore my verse to constancy confined,	s	And thus in strange response he spoke. 	b
One thing expressing, leaves out difference.	s	The circling hills to kiss. 	b
'Fair, kind and true' is all my argument,	s	Where fairer forms in darkness lie ; 	b
To win me soon to hell, my female evil	s	That time is treasuring up for me. 	b
And in this change is my invention spent,	s	Sound through the granite glen ; 	b
Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.	s	All vague and undefined ? 	b
'Fair, kind, and true,' have often lived alone,	s	That sad lament was ringing ; 	b
For that which longer nurseth the disease,	s	Twill break for thee. 	b
When in the chronicle of wasted time	s	Such dreamy, dreary singing. 	b
I see descriptions of the fairest wights,	s	Aware her last hour approaching fast, 	b
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme	s	Of mirror broken on the grass, 	b
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,	s	Watch for a bird with sable wing, 	b
Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,	s	And weaker minds would fear. 	b
Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,	s	I listened to thy mournful sighing. 	b
I see their antique pen would have express'd	s	Were by a faint breeze blown ; 	b
Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall.	s	I knew the source whence sprung those tears 	b
So all their praises are but prophecies	s	They raise their eyes, for the sunny skies 	b
Of this our time, all you prefiguring;	s	Reveal ; where o'er a lone green wood 	b
'I hate' she alter'd with an end,	s	How well my spirit knows the path 	b
They had not skill enough your worth to sing:	s	Was given me in that silent hour 	b
For we, which now behold these present days,	s	In a yeoman's home-close grew ; 	b
Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.	s	In cell and cloister drear ; 	b
Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul	s	At last the sunshine left the ground, 	b
Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.	s	The bright blue flowers and velvet sod, 	b
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured	s	Were strange conductors to the bowers 	b
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;	s	I need not fear my foes, 	b
Incertainties now crown themselves assured	s	Aid for that which lies before. 	b
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.	s	In a grave that never shuts its dead 	b
But do not so; I love thee in such sort	s	Gazed o'er the sands the waves efface 	b
My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,	s	In cloudy morning clothed the sky. 	b
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:	s	Come, sit down on this sunny stone ; 	b
And thou in this shalt find thy monument,	s	I saw His wisdom infinite, 	b
When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.	s	In her uncovered eye ; 	b
What's in the brain that ink may character	s	But beneath the earth is midnight 	b
Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?	s	Waiting to hear the lingering feet 	b
What's new to speak, what new to register,	s	And whistles round the gloomy wall, 	b
That may express my love or thy dear merit?	s	And lingering long, and thinking grieves, 	b
Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,	s	How it longed how it burned to be free ! 	b
I must, each day say o'er the very same,	s	And no one laughed, and none seemed free from 	b
The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.	s	He wakens, and how ghastly white 	b
Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.	s	By whom all things were made ; 	b
That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?	s	So, resting on a heathy bank, 	b
Weighs not the dust and injury of age,	s	And will sustain when thou art gone. 	b
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,	s	me mourn ; 	b
But makes antiquity for aye his page,	s	An anguish in his bosom now ; 	b
Finding the first conceit of love there bred	s	COMPANIONS all day long we 've stood 	b
Where time and outward form would show it dead.	s	Fixed strainedly on the vacant air ; 	b
O, never say that I was false of heart,	s	His wisdom so divine, 	b
Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify.	s	Weak, wretched sinner though I be, 	b
As easy might I from myself depart	s	Sleeping silently and still, 	b
As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:	s	On Eversham's woody brow. 	b
That is my home of love: if I have ranged,	s	That living, is not nobler now 	b
Like him that travels I return again,	s	Too full to hide their tears, too stern to overflow ; 	b
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,	s	To see the sunshine disappear ; 	b
So that myself bring water for my stain.	s	The breeze sings like a summer breeze 	b
Never believe, though in my nature reign'd	s	Then silent weep J cannot weep, 	b
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,	s	Cut off from hope in early day, 	b
O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,	s	From earth and glory cut away. 	b
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;	s	That haunts his feudal home ; 	b
For nothing this wide universe I call,	s	Must image forth the scowl of night, 	b
Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.	s	And childhood's flower must waste its bloom 	b
Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there	s	Beneath the shadow of the tomb. 	b
And made myself a motley to the view,	s	Though vengeance held a sheathed sword 	b
Made old offences of affections new;	s	And still did evening fall ; 	b
Most true it is that I have look'd on truth	s	Through infinite immensity. 	b
Askance and strangely: but, by all above,	s	Wave gently round her head. 	b
These blenches gave my heart another youth,	s	Tells what once those features were, 	b
And worse essays proved thee my best of love.	s	By that celestial shine I 	b
Now all is done, have what shall have no end:	s	And the dying their last watch were keeping 	b
Mine appetite I never more will grind	s	Let us be laid in lasting rest, 	b
Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,	s	Lost their robes of tender green ? 	b
A god in love, to whom I am confined.	s	That I should greet approaching feet, 	b
Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,	s	Half the sweet, the haunting smile ; 	b
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.	s	Other desires and other hopes beset me, 	b
O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,	s	There is a voice in the wind that waves 	b
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,	s	And pleasure tune its chords again. 	b
That did not better for my life provide	s	And my eyes cannot hold the tears 	b
Than public means which public manners breeds.	s	Was it some feeling of delight, 	b
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,	s	From the time of morning's earliest dew 	b
And almost thence my nature is subdued	s	Blasts with that oath his perjured soul, 	b
To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:	s	Kindle a short and bitter smile, 	b
Pity me then and wish I were renew'd;	s	The sun of evening died, 	b
Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink	s	Sleep, stilly sleep, thou bright-haired child, 	b
My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,	s	Its large dark eyes of shadowy light, 	b
No bitterness that I will bitter think,	s	Waveless and calm lies that silent deep 	b
Nor double penance, to correct correction.	s	They fleck with shade our mountains bright 	b
Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye	s	A little longer in this reverie : 	b
Even that your pity is enough to cure me.	s	Upon its heathy shores. 	b
To swear against the truth so foul a lie!	s	But not a dream of sleep ; 	b
Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;	s	Ah ! could my hand unlock its chain, 	b
For what care I who calls me well or ill,	s	Were off like light again. 	b
So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?	s	For every torturing tear. 	b
You are my all the world, and I must strive	s	And chained was every tongue. 	b
To know my shames and praises from your tongue:	s	To mourn o'er what I mourn. 	b
None else to me, nor I to none alive,	s	God ! bless her sun with victory, 	b
That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.	s	In some warm nook a couch to find. 	b
In so profound abysm I throw all care	s	strong and far : 	b
Of others' voices, that my adder's sense	s	Fluttering from the autumn tree. 	b
To critic and to flatterer stopped are.	s	That through the shadows shone 	b
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:	s	The languid lid would close, 	b
You are so strongly in my purpose bred	s	Though I no more may watchful bend 	b
That all the world besides methinks are dead.	s	Through dreams where startling imagery 	b
Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;	s	Can no memory now recall 	b
And that which governs me to go about	s	Home to their journey's end ; 	b
Doth part his function and is partly blind,	s	ALONE I sat ; the summer day 	b
Thine, by thy beauty being false to me.	s	Had died in smiling light away ; 	b
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;	s	Returning to my breast again. 	b
Of bird of flower, or shape, which it doth latch:	s	For past misery are we weeping? 	b
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more	s	I will sail the desert sea. 	b
From heaven to hell is flown away;	s	Roams in the dawn of day ; 	b
For if it see the rudest or gentlest sight,	s	The harvest-moon looks down ; 	b
The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,	s	Look on those woods, look on that mountain lorn, 	b
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?	s	I '11 hide it in my heart no more, 	b
With all triumphant splendor on my brow;	s	Then why is all so sad and lone? 	b
Incapable of more, replete with you,	s	How invincible its roar, 	b
My most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue.	s	A shattered wreck on ocean's tide, 	b
Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,	s	But that at Ambition's bidding, 	b
Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?	s	The heart so long endeared to thee, 	b
The more I hear and see just cause of hate?	s	Are you a hawk to follow the prey, 	b
And that your love taught it this alchemy,	s	Till death shall sound his signal cry, 	b
To make of monsters and things indigest	s	Visions by ardent fancy fed 	b
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,	s	And yet a dreamlike comfort came 	b
Creating every bad a perfect best,	s	But now, when I had hoped to sing, 	b
No want of conscience hold it that I call	s	My fingers strike a tuneless string ; 	b
O,'tis the first; 'tis flattery in my seeing,	s	Who bound us in one vigorous whole 	b
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:	s	Still clung she to his bridle rein 	b
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,	s	Yet have I read these falcon eyes, 	b
And to his palate doth prepare the cup:	s	He faintly prayed, < O Death, delay 	b
If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin	s	But a tyrant spell has bound me, 	b
That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.	s	'Tis like old age pretending 	b
Those lines that I before have writ do lie,	s	Roofless, crumbling to the ground ; 	b
Even those that said I could not love you dearer:	s	Their bare boughs weighed with snow, 	b
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why	s	We both together struck the blow ; 	b
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.	s	And yet I cannot go. 	b
But reckoning time, whose million'd accidents	s	OH, all the cares these noontide airs 	b
Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings,	s	Wastes beyond wastes below ; 	b
Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,	s	When the sun first crowned the hill, 	b
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve	s	Beneath these sullen skies? 	b
Alas, why, fearing of time's tyranny,	s	I 'LL come when thou art saddest, 	b
Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'	s	Bring light to the darkened room, 	b
When I was certain o'er incertainty,	s	When the rude day's mirth has vanished, 	b
Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?	s	Spirit of bliss ! what brings thee here, 	b
Love is a babe; then might I not say so,	s	Long he gazed and held his breath, 	b
To give full growth to that which still doth grow?	s	I '11 come when the heart's worst feeling 	b
Let me not to the marriage of true minds	s	Has entire, unbiassed sway, 	b
Admit impediments. Love is not love	s	But some I read so well, 	b
Which alters when it alteration finds,	s	And gives to fancy magic power 	b
Or bends with the remover to remove:	s	It was a summer day that saw 	b
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark	s	Listen ! 'tis just the hour, 	b
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;	s	But who reads not through the tender glow 	b
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks	s	But thank your passion not for me ! 	b
Within his bending sickle's compass come:	s	A flood of strange sensations roll, 	b
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,	s	Forerunners of a sterner power, 	b
If this be error and upon me proved,	s	Heralds of me? 	b
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.	s	THE soft unclouded blue of air, 	b
Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all	s	Shining through darkness, sweetly spoke 	b
Wherein I should your great deserts repay,	s	How daredst thou wake thoughts in me, 	b
Tempteth my better angel from my side,	s	And lived upon this weary Earth 	b
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;	s	But then I knew that he stood free, 	b
And given to time your own dear-purchased right	s	Was it the smile of early spring 	b
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds	s	And then I felt . . . \unfinished\. 	b
Which should transport me farthest from your sight.	s	Now trust a heart that trusts in you, 	b
Book both my wilfulness and errors down	s	Douglas leaned above the well ; 	b
And on just proof surmise accumulate;	s	And may not be forgiven. 	b
Bring me within the level of your frown,	s	My heart is with your heart at home ; 	b
But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;	s	cold, cold is my heart ! 	b
Since my appeal says I did strive to prove	s	We both were scorned, both sternly driven 	b
The constancy and virtue of your love.	s	Over his own unhappy soul ; 	b
Like as, to make our appetites more keen,	s	Unless I change in every thought, 	b
With eager compounds we our palate urge,	s	And memory will restore me nought, 	b
As, to prevent our maladies unseen,	s	Look now she rests below, 	b
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge,	s	The clouds are earthward yearning ; 	b
Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,	s	The smothering snow-clouds rolled away ; 	b
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding	s	The barren mountain-side lies bare, 	b
And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness	s	He would not give one moorland wild 	b
To be diseased ere that there was true needing.	s	As shines earth's sun in summer noon 	b
Thus policy in love, to anticipate	s	And whiter brows than yours may be, 	b
The ills that were not, grew to faults assured	s	Where city walls spread wide around 	b
And brought to medicine a healthful state	s	And lightning looks from orbs divine 	b
Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured:	s	About my pathway burn and shine. 	b
Now counting best to be with you alone,	s	But that pure light, changeless and strong, 	b
Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.	s	That last dim beam that sets for thee, 	b
Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,	s	Echoing to their bells. 	b
Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,	s	My feeble faith still clings to Thee. 	b
Still losing when I saw myself to win!	s	When we were wont to burst away 	b
What wretched errors hath my heart committed,	s	Remembrance never dies, 	b
Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!	s	From hope, and peace, and power, and 	b
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted	s	Her former life's eventful day 	b
In the distraction of this madding fever!	s	Know nought akin to our despair ; 	b
O benefit of ill! now I find true	s	Without a voice to speak to you 	b
That better is by evil still made better;	s	For that mist may break when the sun is high, 	b
My nobler part to my gross body's treason;	s	For bygone griefs and dried-up tears. 	b
Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.	s	In open day and cheerful sun, 	b
So I return rebuked to my content	s	Lord Lesley, let it free ; 	b
And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.	s	Waiting the death that was to come. 	b
That you were once unkind befriends me now,	s	On which it ought to wend. 	b
And for that sorrow which I then did feel	s	Sleep brings no strength to me, 	b
Needs must I under my transgression bow,	s	Must claim from Justice lasting rest ; 	b
Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.	s	Youth's warm affections gave, 	b
For if you were by my unkindness shaken	s	To meet its early tomb ? 	b
As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time,	s	Mad though that anguish be, 	b
And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken	s	As warm as middle June. 	b
O, that our night of woe might have remember'd	s	And yet it seems a dreary moor, 	b
My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,	s	Was heavier far than earth can be ; 	b
And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd	s	A shelter from the sky. 	b
And each, though enemies to either's reign,	s	And never Fejian devotee 	b
But that your trespass now becomes a fee;	s	My only wish is to forget 	b
Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.	s	In endless sleep of death. 	b
'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd,	s	Fireless hearths, and lifeless homes ; 	b
When not to be receives reproach of being,	s	Had they but seen their idol then, 	b
And the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd	s	Strong I stand, and laugh to see 	b
Thyself away art resent still with me;	s	That leaf from its parent tree ; 	b
For why should others false adulterate eyes	s	Shut out from joy and liberty, 	b
Give salutation to my sportive blood?	s	All the puny ways of men ; 	b
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,	s	The first to fight, the last to fall, 	b
Which in their wills count bad what I think good?	s	Then come again ; thou wilt not shrink 	b
No, I am that I am, and they that level	s	The glory of the festal day, 	b
At my abuses reckon up their own:	s	Ought for a moment to be mine : 	b
I may be straight, though they themselves be bevel;	s	Affrightened from that ceaseless roar. 	b
By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown;	s	Beneath its mighty glare : 	b
Unless this general evil they maintain,	s	Thing of Dust, with boundless pride, 	b
All men are bad, and in their badness reign.	s	Dare you ask me for a guide ? 	b
Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain	s	Will hardly let her gleam, 	b
Full character'd with lasting memory,	s	Or any, but an exile's doom. 	b
Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love	s	Windows through whose broken panes the night- 	b
Beyond all date, even to eternity;	s	To free the world from tyrant's chain, 	b
Or at the least, so long as brain and heart	s	For which we fought and bled and died. 	b
Have faculty by nature to subsist;	s	I saw her give th' unanswered kiss 	b
That in the very refuse of thy deeds	s	Full soon divided him from me. 	b
Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.	s	Where their bright glories shone at first. 	b
That poor retention could not so much hold,	s	To shelter 'neath a foreign heaven ; 	b
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;	s	Till far beyond earth's frenzied strife, 	b
Therefore to give them from me was I bold,	s	That should startle the nations that rest around. 	b
To trust those tables that receive thee more:	s	What pleasant airs upon her face 	b
To keep an adjunct to remember thee	s	Confused and strange and drear. 	b
Were to import forgetfulness in me.	s	She sits and fondly seems to trace 	b
No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:	s	And never more at early dawning 	b
Thy pyramids built up with newer might	s	And I must see the final gloom 	b
To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;	s	The accursed man shall be ; 	b
They are but dressings of a former sight.	s	Dear childhood's innocence forgive, 	b
Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire	s	And my eye can wander through worlds of light. 	b
Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write	s	Methinks their chime sounds faint and drear, 	b
And rather make them born to our desire	s	My lids closed down, yet through their veil 	b
Than think that we before have heard them told.	s	The glory of a summer sky. 	b
Thy registers and thee I both defy,	s	And form my mood to Nature's mood. 	b
Not wondering at the present nor the past,	s	The tiny ripples flame. 	b
O, from what power hast thou this powerful might	s	Went, and ne'er returned again ! 	b
Made more or less by thy continual haste.	s	I cannot bear to go away. 	b
This I do vow and this shall ever be;	s	May beam the blaze of July's sun, 	b
I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee.	s	To soothe your grief or calm your care ; 	b
If my dear love were but the child of state,	s	Nay, do not weep ; that bitter mourning 	b
It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd'	s	And man's remarks or sighs or scorn, 	b
As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,	s	Full many a heart, that in the tomb, 	b
Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.	s	For ever dark, for ever cold. 	b
No, it was builded far from accident;	s	You '11 dry your tears and check your sighing, 	b
It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls	s	Lie low and lone the silent dead ; 	b
Under the blow of thralled discontent,	s	FALL, leaves, fall ; die, flowers, away ; 	b
Whereto the inviting time our fashion calls:	s	If I were quite alone, 	b
It fears not policy, that heretic,	s	One ripple in the lovely lake ; 	b
Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,	s	Lost, cursed, degraded all for thee ! 	b
But all alone stands hugely politic,	s	There are bones whitening there in the 	b
That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers.	s	Fernando left his home and you, 	b
To this I witness call the fools of time,	s	And still I think you must remember 	b
Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.	s	Marking my despondency. 	b
Were 't aught to me I bore the canopy,	s	Lit by the evening flame, 	b
With my extern the outward honouring,	s	I longed to see his face again, 	b
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer	s	From his daylong dream at once he woke ; 	b
Which prove more short than waste or ruining?	s	Better that I my own fate mourning, 	b
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour	s	Except for you, my dearest queen ! 	b
Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,	s	There lies a lone and lovely glade, 	b
For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,	s	And there the hearts together nourished, 	b
Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?	s	Since parted from thee I am left alone, 	b
No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,	s	The afternoon in softened glory 	b
And take thou my oblation, poor but free,	s	In the old church beneath the stone, 	b
Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,	s	And the broad park spread before me 	b
But mutual render, only me for thee.	s	And curse instead of pray. 	b
Hence, thou suborn'd informer! a true soul	s	And there I stood when he had left me, 	b
When most impeach'd stands least in thy control.	s	With ashy cheek and tearless eye, 	b
Now with the drops of this most balmy time	s	Watching the ship whose sail bereft me 	b
Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hour;	s	In gathering gloom in every glade, 	b
Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st	s	By the wild storm blasts roughly broke, 	b
Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st;	s	O may I never lose the peace 	b
If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,	s	My soul still bounded o'er the billow, 	b
As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,	s	The curtains waved, the wakened flies 	b
She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill	s	The azure flowers where they were nursed, 	b
May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.	s	One brief glimpse to thine eye, I 	b
Love is too young to know what conscience is;	s	Its much-desired repose. 	b
She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:	s	Of safe deliverance from the sea. 	b
Her audit, though delay'd, answer'd must be,	s	Yet, alas ! the sooner turning 	b
And her quietus is to render thee.	s	And drowned my bloom of youth in tears. 	b
In the old age black was not counted fair,	s	And time at length brought power for coping 	b
Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;	s	With thoughts I could not once endure. 	b
But now is black beauty's successive heir,	s	MAY flowers are opening, 	b
And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:	s	The place that saw our last farewell, 	b
For since each hand hath put on nature's power,	s	Yet their lives passed in gloomy woe, 	b
Fairing the foul with art's false borrow'd face,	s	In plundered churches piled with dead 	b
Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,	s	Go out upon the breezy moor ; 	b
But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.	s	AWAKE, awake ! how loud the stormy morning 	b
Therefore my mistress' brows are raven black,	s	Calls up to life the nation's resting round ; 	b
Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem	s	What follows in Ula's garden sweet 	b
At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,	s	And violet and wild woodrose 	b
Slandering creation with a false esteem:	s	One whisper, one sweet dream in him, 	b
Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe,	s	' Twill only yield another sight 	b
How oft, when thou, my music, music play'st,	s	That while the world was lost to her 	b
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds	s	A beam of glory there, 	b
What merit do I in myself respect,	s	It was cultured by another hand, 	b
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,	s	A traitor's perjury. 	b
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap	s	And her look of Majesty. 	b
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,	s	The sea-green standard lies in dust beneath. 	b
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,	s	To which my own was given ; 	b
But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,	s	Soldiers, preserve that glory bright and free ; 	b
To be so tickled, they would change their state	s	It was just the time of eve, 	b
And situation with those dancing chips,	s	Let me remember half the woes 	b
O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,	s	Are but the shattered glass 	b
Making dead wood more blest than living lips.	s	Can still the spirit's storm ; 	b
Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,	s	While thou canst speak with such a tone ! 	b
Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.	s	But how can I live lonely here? 	b
At random from the truth vainly express'd;	s	From turret, tower and wall. 	b
Is lust in action; and till action, lust	s	And prone to every sin ; 	b
Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,	s	And in the haze of glorious light 	b
Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,	s	I have sat lonely all the day, 	b
Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight,	s	In the pure light of childhood's morn, 	b
Past reason hunted, and no sooner had	s	Where blackbird and the throstle dwell ; 	b
Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait	s	Save that deep gong which tolled my 	b
On purpose laid to make the taker mad;	s	A thousand strains of Music swell. 	b
Mad in pursuit and in possession so;	s	For God alone doth know how blessed 	b
Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;	s	And every listener swears it true ; 	b
A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;	s	And tell me, why such blessed sleep 	b
Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.	s	Unlike the bloom I like to see. 	b
All this the world well knows; yet none knows well	s	So full of soul, so deeply sweet ; 	b
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.	s	The grave must close those limbs around, 	b
The uncertain sickly appetite to please.	s	The moonbeam and the storm, 	b
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;	s	While the wind is whispering only, 	b
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;	s	Cheeks are pale and eyes are dim. 	b
For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,	s	How can I break these iron chains, 	b
I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,	s	Are the hours to come, the joyless hours, 	b
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;	s	With beams of such impartial blaze, 	b
And in some perfumes is there more delight	s	It chained the snow-swollen streams no more. 	b
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.	s	And they will reach it soon. 	b
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know	s	And then a sudden flash of flame, 	b
I grant I never saw a goddess go;	s	And leave my human feelings 	b
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:	s	Into my heart and anxious eye, 	b
And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare	s	Then his eyes began to weary, 	b
As any she belied with false compare.	s	Amid the howling storm of war? 	b
In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,	s	care and tears and pain. 	b
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;	s	But coldly breaks November's day ; 	b
For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart	s	But hate eternally. 1 	b
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.	s	Eldenna's waves are rolling red, 	b
The little Love-god lying once asleep	s	Shade of history, I condemn 	b
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan:	s	If my spirit's eye can see, 	b
To say they err I dare not be so bold,	s	And deeper green is on the hill. 	b
Although I swear it to myself alone.	s	I looked out to see her there, 	b
And, to be sure that is not false I swear,	s	They all are held in me ; 	b
A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,	s	And all seem glad their voice to hear ; 	b
One on another's neck, do witness bear	s	Wisdom, scorned, knows no relenting ; 	b
Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.	s	A tear might flow, ay, many a tear, 	b
In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,	s	And there in those wild bowers 	b
And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.	s	No whisper, not to me ; 	b
Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,	s	I could not sleep through that wild siege, 	b
Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,	s	I know that I have done thee wrong, 	b
Have put on black and loving mourners be,	s	And mourned a love for ever flown. 	b
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.	s	Sank back again to childhood's day ; 	b
And truly not the morning sun of heaven	s	Its cheering smile to see, 	b
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,	s	That sin was purified by woe. 	b
Nor that full star that ushers in the even	s	Your worlds of solemn light, again, 	b
Doth half that glory to the sober west,	s	To us, in unimagined bloom, 	b
As those two mourning eyes become thy face:	s	And she springs up in haste to greet 	b
O, let it then as well beseem thy heart	s	And thou art near thy prime? 	b
Growing a bath and healthful remedy	s	It was a pleasant April day 	b
And suit thy pity like in every part.	s	So I knew that he was dying 	b
Then will I swear beauty herself is black	s	Watching the drizzly mist descend, 	b
And all they foul that thy complexion lack.	s	Descend like rain upon the heath. 	b
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan	s	Its deadly mist o'er joys and cares. 	b
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!	s	Held by the mountain men. 	b
If thou turn back, and my loud crying still.	s	Like bandit-knife was hung. 	b
But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?	s	And what shall change that angel brow, 	b
And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:	s	To-day, I will seek not the shadowy region ; 	b
Of him, myself, and thee, I am forsaken;	s	Laid on the grass I lapsed away, 	b
A torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd.	s	Blend with a song of troubled times. 	b
For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured eye,	s	To seize the falling rein. 	b
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;	s	Thus thy first hour's course shall be : 	b
Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;	s	With voice subdued and steady look, 	b
Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol:	s	Spring grass grows green and fair ; 	b
And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,	s	Call Death yes Death he is mine own, 	b
What means the world to say it is not so?	s	To live in every sweetest thought ; 	b
So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,	s	And sweeter than a flute's reply 	b
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,	s	Where royal corpses lay. 	b
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine	s	And there was eastern incense burnt, 	b
Thou wilt restore, to be my comfort still:	s	For sun, before they close, 	b
But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,	s	In mercy launch one arrow more ; 	b
For thou art covetous and he is kind;	s	With sacred halos round it shed ? 	b
He learn'd but surety-like to write for me	s	But death has stolen our company, 	b
Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.	s	And words upon the breezes hung. 	b
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,	s	Its sufferings and its tears. 	b
Thou usurer, that put'st forth all to use,	s	' Bless it ! My gracious God ! ' I cried. 	b
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.	s	Welcome at last, though once so drear. 	b
So him I lose through my unkind abuse.	s	Thus, at least, its mouldering corpse will nourish 	b
Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:	s	Shall our feet forget the way ? 	b
He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.	s	Vainly would man divine or tell. 	b
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'	s	STRONG I stand, though I have borne 	b
To thee I send this written embassage,	s	Look how in sable gloom 	b
More than enough am I that vex thee still,	s	A darker wave. 	b
To thy sweet will making addition thus.	s	Glows o'er the graves of Elrington, 	b
Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,	s	It was about the middle night 	b
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?	s	So their fond hearts were free, 	b
Shall will in others seem right gracious,	s	The shallow wrecks of memories 	b
And in my will no fair acceptance shine?	s	Looks down on the descending sun ; 	b
The sea all water, yet receives rain still	s	Thou art my intimate delight, 	b
And in abundance addeth to his store;	s	Deep secrets of His Providence 	b
So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'	s	It pines in cold captivity, 	b
One will of mine, to make thy large 'Will' more.	s	One penance tender tears. 	b
Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;	s	HINDER me by no delay ! 	b
Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'	s	He dared not say me nay the hinges harshly turn. 	b
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,	s	Yonder they stand and watch the waves 	b
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will,'	s	What have I now? The star that brightly 	b
So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,	s	Dry thine eyes, too ; 'tis vain to keep 	b
Thus far for love my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.	s	HOW CLEAR SHE SHINES 	b
'Will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love,	s	Now seems as nothing in the single cloud 	b
Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.	s	That laid my best affections low, 	b
In things of great receipt with ease we prove	s	That thou wouldst call to mind. 	b
Among a number one is reckon'd none:	s	And yet, a king, though Prudence well 	b
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:	s	My horse had strayed, I cannot say ; 	b
Though in thy stores' account I one must be;	s	Zamorna is this nobly done, 	b
For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold	s	But could the day seem dark to me 	b
That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:	s	Those tones were softer than the moan 	b
And then thou lovest me, for my name is 'Will.'	s	Has passed from summer's heaven divine, 	b
Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,	s	I ask for nothing further here 	b
That they behold, and see not what they see?	s	From the side of the wintry brae. 	b
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,	s	I should not be if that were gone 	b
Yet what the best is take the worst to be.	s	YES, holy be thy resting-place 	b
If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks	s	THROUGH the hours of yesternight 	b
Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,	s	She murmured with a sigh. 	b
Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,	s	And nations round are fearing, 	b
From hence your memory death cannot take,	s	So humbly by her side ; 	b
Why should my heart think that a several plot	s	That set on fire my heart, but froze upon my 	b
Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?	s	An icy glory caught mine eye, 	b
Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not,	s	O come away ! The Norman door 	b
To put fair truth upon so foul a face?	s	And my glad heart bound wilder still. 	b
In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,	s	From his heart's fountain swell, 	b
And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.	s	My hour of rest had fleeted by, 	b
Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay.	s	Toss up the window's velvet veil, 	b
I do believe her, though I know she lies,	s	What is past can hurt no more ; 	b
That she might think me some untutor'd youth,	s	To sit within this Norman door, 	b
Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.	s	No : that I feel can never be ; 	b
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,	s	* Angora's hills have heard their tread, 	b
Although she knows my days are past the best,	s	* Well, thou hast fought for many a year, 	b
Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:	s	Like youth, to my maturer eyes, 	b
On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd.	s	She sees us, sister, now ; 	b
Yet be most proud of that which I compile,	s	And I have sat and watched the trees, 	b
O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,	s	Their glory-haloed crown to wear. 	b
And age in love loves not to have years told:	s	And merry words to whispers die, 	b
Therefore I lie with her and she with me,	s	Whose forms have troubled me, 	b
And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.	s	The woods and fields and golden flowers 	b
O, call not me to justify the wrong	s	That we must bind thee down and clench thy 	b
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;	s	Is welcome as a friend ; 	b
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;	s	Though earth and man were gone, 	b
Use power with power and slay me not by art.	s	False and foolish mortal know, 	b
Tell me thou lovest elsewhere, but in my sight,	s	I 've trod a dark and frightful way. 	b
Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:	s	As kindly as the good. 	b
What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might	s	The pure blue heaven with clouds of gold ; 	b
Is more than my o'er-press'd defense can bide?	s	Though not for fear, though not for shame. 	b
Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows	s	Which shapeless figures on each piece 	b
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,	s	Those eyes shall make my only day, 	b
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,	s	As long as thou, the solemn night, 	b
Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,	s	My outward sense is gone, my inward essence 	b
Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.	s	And the crags where I wandered of old. 	b
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press	s	Joins the mad world in all its scorn. 	b
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;	s	Bore his soul from earth away. 	b
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express	s	Then why lament that those we love 	b
The manner of my pity-wanting pain.	s	And wild birds bursting from their songless nest, 	b
If I might teach thee wit, better it were,	s	But yet it was a glorious sun, 	b
Though not to love, yet, love, to tell me so;	s	When, if my spirit's sky was full of flashes 	b
As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,	s	What my soul bore, my soul alone 	b
No news but health from their physicians know;	s	Have studied long their glance and feel 	b
For if I should despair, I should grow mad,	s	And all my prospect of relief 	b
And in my madness might speak ill of thee:	s	His heart is stirred through all its strings, 	b
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,	s	And then a wakening from above ; 	b
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be,	s	As it tossed against the heaven, 	b
That I may not be so, nor thou belied,	s	
Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.	s	
In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,	s	
For they in thee a thousand errors note;	s	
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,	s	
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;	s	
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted,	s	
Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,	s	
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited	s	
To any sensual feast with thee alone:	s	
But my five wits nor my five senses can	s	
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,	s	
Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,	s	
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be:	s	
Only my plague thus far I count my gain,	s	
That she that makes me sin awards me pain.	s	
Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate,	s	
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:	s	
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,	s	
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;	s	
Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,	s	
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments	s	
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;	s	
Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.	s	
Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lovest those	s	
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:	s	
Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows	s	
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.	s	
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,	s	
By self-example mayst thou be denied!	s	
Lo! as a careful housewife runs to catch	s	
One of her feather'd creatures broke away,	s	
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?	s	
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay,	s	
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,	s	
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent	s	
To follow that which flies before her face,	s	
Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;	s	
So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,	s	
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,	s	
But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,	s	
And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind:	s	
So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'	s
