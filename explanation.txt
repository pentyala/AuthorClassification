Features Used:

I got these features by manually going through the both writings.

Stop words:
    Removed all the stop words before calculating features. 
    Basic for any text processing

On going through the two texts, I found that Shakespeare uses more words in each line.

length of tokens
    Used the tokenizer to tokenize the string, and used the number of tokens as a feature

POS
    Tried the POS tags such that, number of nouns and the way how they occur.
    Also tried working with NGrams on POS but, the accuracy was getting low

    Also used the last word POS as a feature.

length of the lines
    Since shakespeare uses more words, the length of the line is more.

Length of words
    On going through the two texts, I found that Shakespeare uses bigger words in each line.
    Shakespeare uses lengthy words when compared to Bronte
    Used average length of words instead of length of each word to improve accuracy

NGrams
    Used Bigrams and Trigrams which improved the efficiency a little

Tried:

Spaces
    Number of spaces is more for Shakespeare as he uses more words (No change on the accuracy though)

Single Quotes
    On looking at the training data, there were single qoutes more in Shakespeare's when compared to Bronte's text

Exclamation
    Shakespeare used more exclamations when compared with Bronte

Words ending with 'st'
    Shakespeare uses more words that end with 'st'. Example Shouldst, Thoust, Couldst.
    But, it did not improve accuracy instead decreased it.

syllables
    Calculated the number of syllables in a line which I thought will help classify
    As both are poetic writers, I thought number of syllables might help

Adjectives
    Since both of them are great authors, I thought that they will be using more adjectives.
    Used avg adjectives per line to compare the relevancy.
