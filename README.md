# AuthorClassification
Implemented a Naïve Bayes Classifier in Python that identifies authorship for the lines of poetry written by Emily Bronte and William Shakespeare.

## Classify.py
This is an implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier that uses NLTK’s Naive Bayes code. It generates features from training data, evaluates on a small percentage of the training data, then re-trains on the full training data and generates predictions for the test data.
## b.data
Data set of most of the lines written by Emily Bronte
## s.data
Data set of most of the lines written by William Shakespeare
## out.data
Generated predictions
