If it were fill'd with your most high deserts? - s - s 
Who all life long has loved the snow - s - b 
To weigh how once I suffered in your crime. - s - s 
Strove to waken music there ; - b - b 
And, with sudden check, the heaving - b - b 
The heart I love and you deride - s - b 
Of their fair subject, blessing every book - s - s 
Or me, to whom thou gavest it, else mistaking; - s - s 
If Time have any wrinkle graven there; - s - s 
From Gondal's stormy sea. - b - b 
Or laid great bases for eternity, - s - s 
The scope and tenor of thy jealousy? - s - s 
And I never longed for joys divine. - b - b 
And pale death changed that cheek divine - b - b 
Although our undivided loves are one: - s - s 
Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes. - s - s 
And saved my life, saying 'not you.' - s - s 
Thought again to what has been ? - b - b 
Wasted, worn is the traveller, - b - b 
Who plead for love and look for recompense - s - s 
That every tongue says beauty should look so. - s - s 
With ugly rack on his celestial face, - b - s 
< To a silent home thy feet may come, - b - b 
I heard those notes in Elbe Hall, - b - b 
This heart burns with thee and me, - s - b 
A sentence, unapproved, and overruled by Heaven. - b - b 
So am I as the rich, whose blessed key - s - s 
What woke it then ? A little child - b - b 
Now wildly shade my sunburnt neck, - s - b 
More flowers I noted, yet I none could see - s - s 
Harp, in other earlier days - s - b 
Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate' - s - s 
And none of all those thousand round - b - b 
As from this city to the southern seas. - b - b 
But earth was bathed in other gore ; - b - b 
Scarce bound by its worn chains of clay, - b - b 
O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power - s - s 
Warnings, reproaches, both were vain ; - b - b 
When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim - s - s 
Unmarked I gazed, my idle thought - b - b 
But bears it out even to the edge of doom. - s - s 
Dear lady, slumber now ! - b - b 
Well I know thine eye would never - s - b 
Then in the number let me pass untold, - s - s 
Or is he on the sea? - b - b 
And you have all your lives for grief.' - s - b 
The very brightness of the sun, - s - b 
Naming thy name blesses an ill report. - s - s 
Compared with loss of thee will not seem so. - s - s 
Ethereal music fills the air, - b - b 
For at a frown they in their glory die. - s - s 
Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell - s - s 
For she hath no excheckr now but his, - s - s 
Leagues off I heard their thundering roar, - b - b 
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. - s - s 
1 Preserve Thy mortal shrine, - b - b 
Of rock with wave, and wave with rock ; - b - b 
Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end? - s - s 
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds: - s - s 
And still the more beloved, the greater still - s - b 
And feel no other earthly bliss - b - b 
Wander about the silent dwelling, - b - b 
So are those errors that in thee are seen - s - s 
Were pitched 'gainst traitorous crime ; - s - b 
WHEN weary with the long day's care, - b - b 
Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss, - s - s 
A part of God himself shall shine - b - b 
As victors of my silence cannot boast; - s - s 
Those tiny hands in vain essay - b - b 
As sweet tears never melted down - b - b 
After a thousand victories once foil'd, - s - s 
Must slake her vengeance now ! - b - b 
And the smile of joy is banished - b - b 
All soft, and still, and fair ; - b - b 
With never-failing thankfulness, - b - b 
Too base of thee to be remembered. - s - s 
Make answer, Muse: wilt thou not haply say - s - s 
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there; - s - s 
More worthy I to be beloved of thee. - s - s 
WHICH I RODE AT THE BATTLE OF ZAMORNA - s - b 
To do more for me than mine own desert, - s - s 
Even so my sun one early morn did shine - b - s 
But where is all their anguish now, - b - b 
I '11 walk, but not in old heroic traces, - b - b 
Like a star it sparkled through. - s - b 
But ah! thought kills me that I am not thought, - s - s 
The moon is bright in Autumn's sky, - b - b 
All too like that dreary eve, - b - b 
That I have frequent been with unknown minds - s - s 
Waves above thy cradle break, - b - b 
And wherefore say not I that I am old? - s - s 
They must be the chaplet to wreathe my head, - s - b 
* The baited tiger could not be - b - b 
So deem I now and time will prove - s - b 
And all these dim, disjointed dreams - b - b 
Make thee another self, for love of me, - s - s 
And my sick Muse doth give another place. - s - s 
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds, - s - s 
Love's eye is not so true as all men's 'No.' - s - s 
Life that in me has rest, - s - b 
But most throughout the moral world - s - b 
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart, - s - s 
The bright rosebuds, those hawthorn shrouds - b - b 
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake; - s - s 
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind. - s - s 
Often he looks o'er his dreary road, - b - b 
Thou shouldst live in eternal spring, - s - b 
Had they but known her dreary doom, - b - b 
And die as fast as they see others grow; - s - s 
May flow down like a river : - b - b 
To bless my spirit now. - b - b 
Men who hate me kneel before me, - s - b 
How wildly fancy plays. - b - b 
Yet I could hear my lady sing ; - b - b 
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell. - s - s 
While I lie fettered here ! - s - b 
And that, in guess, they measure by thy deeds; - s - s 
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries: - s - s 
And drowns the turret bell, - b - b 
Whose mighty minds with kindred lay, - b - b 
Coming as swiftly and fading as soon. - s - b 
Therefore desire of perfect'st love being made, - s - s 
I never saw that you did painting need - s - s 
The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits! - b - s 
Let me confess that we two must be twain, - s - s 
Foamy tears are on thy cheek, - s - b 
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow, - s - s 
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest - s - s 
He had watched with tend'rest care. - b - b 
So, love, be thou; although to-day thou fill - s - s 
But sorrow withers e'en the strong, - s - b 
What thou dost foist upon us that is old, - s - s 
As every alien pen hath got my use - s - s 
My slave, my comrade, and my king. - s - b 
Art glad to leave the sea, - b - b 
Hast faithless been to him ? - s - b 
Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you, - s - s 
Of happiness or woe? - b - b 
Declining to the afternoon ; - b - b 
The morning sunshine had called him forth, - b - b 
But thence I learn, and find the lesson true, - s - s 
And sable curls all silver'd o'er with white; - s - s 
Look, what thy memory can not contain - s - s 
That black treason uttered well - s - b
